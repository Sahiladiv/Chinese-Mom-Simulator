I began by scraping Reddit discussions on Asian identity and parenting to build a dataset rich in emotional nuance and intergenerational dynamics. 
Reddit was chosen because its open format surfaces candid, high-context perspectives—exactly the type of discourse that focus groups and surveys often fail to capture. 

By fine-tuning Falcon-7B with LoRA adapters, I was able to model not just surface-level responses but also the affective undertones—pride, frustration, guilt, and contradiction—that shape real human dialogue.

This modeling work was guided by persona design: building “voices” that reflect culture, migration histories, and class context. 

Each persona isn’t a stereotype, but a simulation of how identity and experience color response patterns. 

The design assumptions allow the engine to approximate how different communities might react under similar prompts, while ethical guardrails ensure we avoid caricature or amplification of harmful tropes.

At scale, this fine-tuning can become a foundational block in Veil’s simulation engine. By layering retrieval systems, real-time orchestration across 500+ personas, and interactive visualizations like heatmaps and contradiction flags, we can replace the static, costly focus group with a living, computational model of emotional and behavioral response.
