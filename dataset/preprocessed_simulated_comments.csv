"Ever since I came home, my mom's cooking doesn't hit anymore and I feel guilty.
For context, I spent 7 months in Army basic. The whole time I was there, I dreamt of being able to eat my mom's ca kho to and many other things. Also, I thought that Army food was so bad that I would perform better with my mom's cooking.

 When I returned home, I was expecting to relive my childhood through my taste buds, but everything tastes so mid and I have been feeling weaker ever since I got back. She changed what and how she cooked food. She no longer cooks white rice, beef, or mi xao as well as using less salt because my mom and dad are trying to take care of their health.

I tried to stick with their diet by eating larger portions, but I can barely function throughout the day. I often dry heave during workouts, sometimes throughout the day, and have symptoms of hyponatremia. 

Now, I cook my own food or eat out to feel satisfied. It's awful because I feel like I am insulting her cooking. Because of our work schedules, the only time my family meets consistently is at dinner. Sometimes I am too tired to cook, so I just eat out. 

 The other day, she scolded me for drinking liquid IV and coming home with a beef shawarma, saying it was going to damage my kidneys.  I know she cares, but I never knew caring for myself feels like alienating my mom. 

Have you guys ever gone through anything similar? I just wanted to vent and get opinions on this.","As my parents got older, they understandably changed how they ate and the food became less salty.  Now, being in their eighties, it’s changed even more because of their teeth.  

Can you ask her for a favorite dish for a birthday?  

Also, is there room to compromise by eating her cooking occasionally? Eat her cooking, but add salt, and supplement as needed to hit your macros"
"Has anyone else felt cheated out of their culture? If so how have you worked past it?
I grew up in a mostly white area and growing up, I was so ashamed of being Asian. I constantly got made fun of for “stinky food”, for watching anime, for saying words wrong, and just being different. It was especially bad for me because while mostly white, it’s a very liberal area (for America). I constantly had to deal with Asian jokes and was told to just play along to show that it didn’t bother me. Thinking that all race jokes are just jokes, I made a black joke in middle school once and was immediately ostracized for being racist. I genuinely thought being Asian was the worst thing in the world. I spent so much of my childhood whitewashing myself and denying my heritage. I even went out of my way to not get too close to other Asians. 

Now, I’m an adult and I see that anime and Asian food are getting extremely popular. There’s so much anger in me that people I saw make fun of me are now embracing what they made fun of me for. I feel cheated out of a happy childhood where I could learn about my heritage worry free. I’ve been trying to learn Mandarin, and learn more about Taiwanese culture and history. While it’s been great, I still constantly have to remind myself to get rid of the bias I held against Asian for so long. I also constantly have to work past the regret of denying my heritage and shunning other Asian people. 

I’m sure I’m not the only one with this experience. Anyone else gotten past the hurt and feeling cheated? I would love some dialogue on this

Also does anyone have advice on how I might connect with more Asian people? I don’t know if this is too broad of a question but I just feel like I want more friends who share the same pride in being Asian that I’ve been working towards","Not a comment on being ""cheated out"" of your culture, but that thing about food is real.


They'd sh*t on your ethnic food if it's bandwagon to sh*t on it, amd when it becomes a fad, they don't like to be reminded that they once mocked the same food they ""like"" now.


I do remember in the early to mid-2000 when Westerners were mocking Ube because it is a ""weird"" purple food. But after someone made a post of an Ube donut wrapped in edible gold, it suddenly became ""hip"". It's too hip that they label any purple crop as ""Ube"". Like yo, those purple sweet potato from Hawaii are not Ube. Ube is a type of yam, not sweet potato.


Pretty much all the ""Ube boba"" I've had tasted like sweet potato, not purple yam.


Not to sound judgy but none of non-Filipino commercial items I've tasted don't even taste close to purple yam. A lot of times, they just taste like Vanilla with purple food coloring (looking at you TJs) While it would have been nice having Asian culture be popular growing up, I'm not bitter about it because I'm happy that the popularity at least exists now which is not only good for the kids growing up, but also for us now.

In terms of how you can get over it, remember you can't change the past and only move forward which is what you're doing by reconnecting with your heritage. It can also be helpful to spend time with others that validate you and your identity, hence your attempt to connect with others. It'll take some time so be kind to yourself. You can also try therapy especially with an AA therapist.

For how to meet other Asians, it came up recently here: [How did you find your community?](https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1mm7xql/how_did_you_find_your_community/). Basically, go to meetups and events surrounding your interests."
"Should I raise my boy in Canada or US
33AM, born and raised in mainland China. I moved to Canada for school and have been living here ever since. I'm now married (my wife is also Asian), and we have a 6-month-old baby boy.

I really appreciate how diverse Canada is and how much the government supports multiculturalism.

My company is offering to relocate my family to the U.S., where my salary could potentially double, and there would be more opportunities to grow my career. However, I have some concerns. I want my son to grow up feeling confident and at home, ideally in a place where he sees more people who look like him and where diversity is embraced.

Is this something I should be worried about? I’d really appreciate hearing from others who have been in a similar situation or have lived in both Canada and the U.S.",I would stay in Canada right now with how things are going in the U.S. I feel like a lot of us are actually wishing we could flee to Canada! You have it good. where in canada and where in the US?
"Why does it seem there are so few Singaporean Chinese in the US but countless Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese?
My mother is from Singapore and she married my father who is from Hong Kong.

Since I was young, I have only seen or heard of 10 other Chinese people who were either from Singapore or had parents from there but many Chinese people from Hong Kong, Taiwan, or China or had parents from there.","Isn’t Singapore a fairly small and new country? As far as I’m aware, there haven’t been significant issues of famine and/or revolution to chase away portions of their population. There's really not much reason for Singaporeans to immigrate.


The most prominent one I can think of is Kevin Kwan"
"Can I vent for just a moment?
I grew up in Asia then I moved to the USA for Highschool, however living in Asia again for my gap year reinstalled every single Asian Beauty standard right back into my brain. Someone would have to break me to pieces then rebuild me to loosen the chokehold that Asian beauty standards has on me.

Today I forgot my wallet and with the little cash on me I had to choose whether or not I wanted a meal or get a makeup cushion that was on sale, guess which one I chose? Even after getting the cushion I felt disappointed when I realized ""Wait this is my shade"" because I need something lighter.

It takes me about an hour and a half just to get ready for a class reunion; Peel and stretch my double eyelid tape, wait it looks wrong let's peel it off, stick then rip it off and repeat. My double eyelids looked painfully fake so I decided to apply cluster lashes to cover it. My makeup looked great!! However while looking at myself in the mirror, I remembered the last step; To apply my tone up cream, make sure to look pale, lather it on and spread it evenly on both hands, and clean my nails after because it looks white.

Even back in High School in America, I remember applying tone up creams to my body to look paler, ""prettier"" for prom. I'm slowly drowning in the pool that I filled up, but this was influenced by my childhood when  growing up in Asia I was voted the ugliest girl in 5th grade. Actually a classmate from 5th grade managed to recognize me (not at the reunion, randomly in public) and I almost went on a spiral because ""Am I still the ugliest girl? Haven't I changed enough?""

But in reality I have changed a lot, so many people at the reunion could not put a finger on who I was, the guy who recognized me in public was an incredibly close friend whom I spent most my time with back then, which is why he recognized me. Sorry that this got so long but in the end Asian Beauty is a noose that I willingly tighten around my neck. Maybe one day I'll work through my past and my self confidence.

But then again I've only lived in the USA for about 4 years and I feel like no matter how far I am from Asia I will forever hold myself up to their beauty standards. But also I'm still young, I'm about to go into college in the USA and scared shit-less of how I can maintain my tedious routine (I still feel the need to fit the Asian Beauty Standards in America). Even on my college ID, I decided to submit a headshot where I'm wearing my double eyelids not to mention the crazy editing where I look whiter than a paper FML. As I grow older I wish to gain the courage to embrace myself naturally...","I'm an Asian American woman whose spent my life in the US, and as much as Asian Americans are marginalized and underrepresented here, I feel fortunate that Asian *American* beauty standards seem more inclusive and diverse than those in Asian countries. I have pretty thick wavy hair but as a teenager I wished I had the sleek straight hair most Asian girls had and I'd straighten my hair every day, which damaged my hair and also frankly just didn't fit my face shape. I stopped in college after I just didn't have time and have since gotten a lot of compliments on my hair and even see other Asian girls getting perms to *make* their hair wavy, haha. Everyone wants what they don't have I guess.

I don't have good advice to give if you're planning on settling in Asia because I don't have experience there, but if you're planning on spending more time in America, I'd suggest watching more Asian American media content (movies, TV shows, even social media if that's your thing) so you can appreciate the diversity of Asian faces and stories. Actresses like Sandra Oh, Awkwafina, Kelly Marie Tran, and Stephanie Hsu all look quite different from one another but are still celebrated. I get the impression that American culture prefers a more ""natural"" makeup and photo editing look too so it may actually do you a bit of good socially and professionally if you lean into your natural features and take it easy. You'll find most college campuses in the USA are full of young people doing the absolute bare minimum when it comes to personal grooming and dressing.  It was actually a relief from the ridiculous fashion show that was my high school.

In this environment eventually comes the mindset of, ""Why the heck should I try so hard when everyone else looks so schleppy?""

Enjoy, the beauty break.  You can take it up again when it comes time to start your career."
"How to deal with people being racist (perhaps purposefully) within earshot?
A common interaction I come across more than I like is a complete stranger inspecting or glaring at me/my Asian mother and then shortly after, start talking about “too much Asian immigration” or “Asians are.. etc, etc” in PUBLIC SPACES. I usually glare at them but am always left wondering if I can do more to protect myself and my mother or call them out. Literally just today, my family shared a table with this old lady and she started talking about there being “too many immigrants taking up our country’s space” to a complete stranger. This was after she had a convo with my white dad and for the most part of dinner, stared at us like a creep. I did not wave goodbye like my dad did when she said. If anyone could let me know what I could do in situations like this, or other people’s experiences, it would be much appreciated.","I call them out on their racism. It's amusing because calling them racist will likely offend them more than any slur would. It may not change any opinions immediately, but the interaction will certainly stick with them in the future. Because I can guarantee you they absolutely HATE HATE HATE being called racist. Ask her if she is talking about you. Then if she backs off let her know that this is a nation of immigrants and that she needs to seriously reevaluate why she is so ignorant as to who “we the people” are. And if she parrots Christian BS, tell them to read the red words (Jesus talking) in the New Testament. What you do to the least of these, you do to me. 

Basically let her know you clock her as being racist, ignorant and anti-American. I love a little bless your heart patronizing thrown in the sauce"
"How do I respond?
How do I respond to people who ask racist questions to my daughter (22, Asian) that seem innocent to white people? Things like, “Are you going to go back to China to visit someday?” Or making reference to her size and how small she is “since she’s Asian.” I do not think quick on my feet when I want to punch idiots in the throat. The emotions shut down my thinking. I certainly don’t want to be dismissive by saying to her that they didn’t mean it Bla Bla Bla. I asked her if she feels safe telling me about racism she experiences. She said she does but that it’s too much sometimes so she keeps it to herself. I don’t want to interrogate her about how she experiences racism. That doesn’t help but standing up for her in the moment would be the most I could do to show her my support.  What are some quick responses that I can keep filed away in my mind for when this happens again?

I am white and adopted my sweet daughter at 13 months old from China. Thank you in advance for your thoughts. It helps so much.","What you say will make a big impact. White people don't expect white people to call them out on their racism, even if it's a ""microaggression."" I put that in quotes because when you hear it hundreds of times, it's just plain aggressive. 

I would turn it back on them. What makes you ask a question like that? Let them dig themselves in, educate when able, but hold steady and truly challenge them to think outside the pov of the white society and help them to understand the pov of your daughter and you as her mother and what you have noticed being an adoptive mother of a child that is always bothered simply for her race. 

Thank you for sticking up for her and not excusing away all of the bad behavior of others. [deleted]"
"Ni Hao
I grew up in Brooklyn and people would randomly come up to me and say “ni hao.” I took it as fighting words when I was younger as the way they said was accentuated and followed with laughter. When I got older I thought would I take people coming up to me and saying “Ahn young saeyo” as fighting words? But no random person on the street has said the Korean hello to me, ever. A white door knocker came to remind me of the nyc primaries and he started with “ni hao” as soon as I opened the door. I was immediately insulted. I saw how sweaty he was from doing the job and thought maybe he thought this was a good thing to say so I told him, people don’t like that when you automatically say “ni hao” and he said sorry and sounded sincere. But what pains me is that now that my son is out in the world, he told me that while he was at a job interview and going through the hallways to get to the place, a random person said “ni hao” to him and it’s like not only did I have to go through this shit, he’s gotta suffer through this too? What advice would you give to your kid as a parent to deal with this?","A random Ni hao to anybody that remotely looks ""Asian"" is casual racism. No further explanation needed. Don't let the trolls gaslight you into thinking it's ok or that strangers mean no harm. It's not ok because they are assuming something about somebody based on their ethnicity I’ll never forget when some random white lady in Target grabbed me by the arm to tell me that her son LOVES Pokémon, so she really appreciates Asian culture. Mind you, I’m Kazakh. I think the appropriate way to handle these encounters is to respectfully explain how that is offensive and why others may not take it as nicely as they intend. I think with the majority of people who approach like that are trying to be sincere in their own sheltered and un-educated way, they just need a nudge in the right direction. Frustrating nonetheless."
"Seeking Advice: Navigating Subtle Exclusion & Bullying as South Asians in a Predominantly Chinese-American Community
Hi everyone, posting using a throwaway account, as this is a sensitive topic for my family. I’m reaching out to this community with a heavy heart and an open mind, hoping to understand how best to approach a situation that has been increasingly difficult for my family.

We’re a well-educated Indian family—both my wife and I are physicians—and we’ve lived in the U.S. for over 18 years. About a year and a half ago, we moved to a highly ranked public school district in New York, motivated by the reputation of its schools and the promise of a welcoming, intellectually driven neighborhood.

Most of our neighbors here are of Chinese heritage. We were aware of that going in, and honestly, it didn’t concern us in the slightest. Over the years, we’ve had many close friendships with Chinese colleagues in medical school and university—so we anticipated a diverse, respectful environment.

However, the experience we've had here has been unexpectedly isolating. Our child is the only South Asian child in her elementary school class (class composition is 17 Chinese; 2 Caucasian, 1 Indian). An early observation we had was that despite inviting every child in the class to her birthday party, she received only 3 invites in return (1 Chinese classmate, and the 2 Caucasian classmates). We shrugged this off thinking that we were new in the neighborhood, and this hopefully would change with time. However, a year and a half later we still barely get any play date or birthday invites.

When we walk through the neighborhood and greet others, our Chinese neighbors rarely respond—not even a nod or wave—while neighbors of other backgrounds tend to acknowledge us. It’s subtle, but it’s consistent enough that it’s hard to ignore.

More painfully, our daughter was bullied at school by a group of Chinese classmates. One child told her that I (her dad) must be ashamed of her because of how she looks. When confronted by the teacher, the group’s ringleader said she didn’t like how my daughter disagreed with her in class. The incident was reported, and while the school addressed it on some level, we’re left with the deeper discomfort of whether this reflects something broader.

I’m not sure if what we’re experiencing is cultural disconnect, cliquish behavior, or something rooted in bias—but it’s unlike anything we’ve encountered in other communities we’ve lived in. I’d love to hear from others who’ve navigated similar situations:

* Is this something that improves over time with more engagement?
* Are there ways to bridge cultural gaps that feel this resistant?
* At what point do you consider whether a community is simply not the right fit for your family?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts, perspectives, or personal experiences you’re willing to share.","When you say you invited the entire class to your daughter's birthday party and only got 3 invites to other birthday parties, do you know if there were OTHER birthday parties (besides those 3) where your child was excluded? I'm asking because in my experience, some families simply won't do birthday parties so maybe it's not rampant widespread exclusion? In other words, maybe there were 5 parties and and your child was excluded from 2 as opposed to 16 parties? 

Another possibility is that the invite list might have been via WeChat or some other messaging method. Kids might be in other activities where the invite was distributed that way. I can't see a school sending out a custom invite list per party on a parent's behalf.

Hopefully friendship(s) will be formed but if your daughter is miserable about school, I wouldn't wait too long to move. I don't see it as a problem (yet) here in my neck of the woods where there are a lot of Chinese and Indian families co-navigating the school system. I'm Chinese American and grew up in a suburb that was majority White but had a substantial minority of Asians, about equally East and South Asian, and we all ended up being friends with each other. While we did have issues with racism from White peers, I really appreciated that all of us Asians of different ethnicities banded together without any single ethnicity dominating.

I don't think that Chinese Americans or immigrants especially dislike Indians, but in any setting that is very predominantly one race/ethnicity, anyone who is not of that race/ethnicity is going to have a hard time. I can imagine that Chinese immigrant parents who are not fluent in English might feel uncomfortable reaching out to parents who don't know Chinese and prefer to stay in their comfort zone of other fellow Chinese parents. And kids are pretty shallow and will readily pick on people who are visibly different from the majority if their parents don't consciously teach them not to.

I wouldn't begrudge you for wanting to move somewhere with more Indian Americans around because constant feelings of exclusion and singling out are not going to be good for a young person's well-being, while having even some peers who share their background can do a lot of good."

SIDE 1, BAND 2 (3:42)

WANDERING CHINAMAN

Words: ""Charlie"" Chin,

Music: traditional

    I left my home and my parents
    At the age of twenty-one.
    In a family of eight children,
    I was the youngest son.
    Little choice was left to me
    But to go to a foreign land.
    Oh who will mourn the passing
    Of this wandering Chinaman?

    I arrived in this country
    In 1925.

    A sixteen hour day
    Just to try and stay alive.
    When I'd saved enough
    And thought I was doing fine,
    I lost everything I had
    In the crash of 29.

    Seven long years,
    Gambling was my trade.
    I'd wander from city to city
    On the money that I made.
    When I'd saved enough,
    And thought that I was done,
    Then came a world war,
    In 1941.

    Oh lonely and lonely,
    And lonely was my life.
    I decided to marry,
    And sent away for a wife.
    I settled down to a family,
    No longer could I roam.
    I gave up my dreams
    Of ever reaching home.

    I lost my precious wife
    In 1965.
    Without her loving strength,
    How do I stay alive?
   And as for my daughter, she's gone
    To sleep with a red-haired man,
    And I lost my youngest son
    In the war in Vietnam.

    The letter said he died
    To protect democracy.
    But why he had to go at all
    Is still a mystery to me.
    And as for my eldest son,
    For him there is no hope.
    He turns all his money
    To the man that sells him dope.

    So I sit in this park
    Until the night-time comes.
    And I worry for my daughter,
    And I think about my sons.
    I sit inside this park
    And stare into my hands.
    Oh who will mourn the passing
    Of this wandering Chinaman?","Thanks for sharing, hearing the voices of the Asian American experience during a time (Wars in Vietnam and Korea before it) where Asians weren’t exactly liked in America.

We go to fight in wars with every other American, yet still get treated like shit by many in this country…unless they need our votes.

Also, interesting that all the way back in 1973 and dealing with his Asian daughter sleeping with White guys. Guess I didn’t realize it’s been an issue for a long time in our community. Great hidden gem of a song. Thanks for sharing."
"Should I pay off my parent's house?
I’m 30M living with my parents. Together, we bought the home we're living in now, which is the first house my parents have ever owned. Growing up, we always rented because they couldn’t afford to buy. Most of my childhood was spent in a rent-controlled apartment. This house is special to them. They love having a small backyard where they can garden and enjoy being outside.

I currently contribute about $900 a month toward the mortgage. Over the years, I’ve been able to save and invest carefully. My net worth is around $800k, and I’ve reached my FIRE number. My plan is to leave my investments untouched until I turn 40. If all goes well, they should grow to about $1.6 million by then, and I’ll be able to fully retire early and comfortably. Before you ask how I'm able to retire early with such little money, please understand that I grew up in poverty, so I am extremely frugal by nature.

In addition to my investments, I'm currently in the process of saving $200k in a high-yield savings account. I’ve been thinking about using it to help pay off our mortgage. We still owe about $230k. If I put in $200k, it would really help my parents pay it off faster. They’re in their late 50s now. I was the main reason we left our rent-controlled apartment, and I sometimes feel guilty about uprooting them from that stability.

Our mortgage has a 3.5% interest rate through an FHA loan, so I don’t think refinancing is an option. Even with a big payment, the monthly mortgage payment would stay around $2,000.

My own financial goals are already met. I'm part of the LGBTQ community and don’t plan to have kids, and while I do have a few ""fun"" goals that might cost up to $50,000, none of them feel urgent right now.

I’m asking this in the Asian subreddit because I know many of us grew up in multi-generational households where money, guilt, and family duty are tied together. I want to do right by my parents, but I also want to make the smartest long-term decision. I would really appreciate any advice.","Based on what you’ve written, I wouldn’t pay it off, especially at 3.5%. If you just put that 200k in to a market wide index fund, you’d get better returns. You’re still young, so you can be more aggressive.  

Talk with them to see what their retirement plans look like. Get a good handle on their expenses to see what their spend rate is like.  Help them to create their own retirement accounts now to reach that number that would provide for their SWR. This way you get a better idea of where you can plan to help. Regardless of your decision, I want to say how kind and thoughtful you are for thinking of your parents in this way. I know it’s not easy to have achieved what you did. It’s refreshing to read someone has a good head on their shoulders.  

As an AP myself, I can only hope my boys be supportive of me as you are of your parents. I hope your parents have gratitude for your big heart and how much they (can and should!) love you every day. You all are very lucky to have one another!"
"Wanting to Acknowledge Racism that My Daughter Experiences
*Not sure if this should be posted with Question & Discussion flair…
I am white and adopted my daughter from China as an infant.  Lisa is in her 20s now. How can I approach her to acknowledge how fucked up it must be having been raised & living her adult life in a white world?

She’s very easy to talk to and we’ve broached the subject many times but I’ve been educating myself more lately, especially with the moronic, criminal idiots that are in office now. I just don’t want to be more clueless to her. 

Thank you in advance for your thoughts. I want to love her the way she wants and needs to be loved by her mother. I may crosspost this in an adoption thread but I want to hear specifically from the Asian community. What ignorant things can I avoid that I’m not even thinking of?

Also, as of right now, she does not want to visit where she was born or do genetic testing. I told her she could let me know if that’s ever something she’d like and that I would make it happen.","i am also a chinese adoptee. your acknowledgment of how she has been treated differently throughout her life is a big step. tbh as long as you’re aware of the differences, personally don’t think you need to do anything extra. any disparages she experiences on a daily basis she has already found ways to cope and hopefully accepts and embraces her chinese side. although being as open as you are to learning can feel nice and supportive, she is the one in control of accepting her identity if she hasn’t already (especially now that she’s an adult and can fully choose who she surrounds herself with). it’s a tough thing to find your place in and some embrace it, some assimilate. i’d say just listen to her and as long as there is trust within your relationship she will open up to you about things you’ve said/done in the past that might have hurt her and ways you can do better. Just a thought wrt visiting her country of birth:

She may want to do so on her own terms, not on an offer. I know when I was pushed to do so, it was uncomfortable and stiff. When I did so of my own accord some years later, it was a wonderful experience.

And as far as genetic testing, she'll look into it if/when she feels like it. Sometimes these things need to be our own idea, especially now that she's her own person and is standing on her own.

For what it's worth, I wish my adoptive parents had been half as considerate as you. Don't worry, you're doing fine."
"1.5/2nd Gen, ND, AA, and Faith Deconstructing
I may delete this later as I'm typing this from very tender areas. 

I recently joined the subreddit, so I apologize if this has been talked about in the past. I'm really just trying to cope with this loneliness. I've talked about this with my immediate family, but the fact that they're still deep in their faith doesn't necessarily help. Their solution is often in prayer, and yeah, this hasn't helped me. I love them, and I know they love me in their own way. So this isn't about that.   
  
My siblings seem mostly okay with their identity. I've been struggling with mine ever since someone asked me, ""Are you Cantonese?"" in kindergarten. So yes, I am Chinese American. Supposedly. My father was born in the Philippines, but his father was born in Shanghai, and his mother was born in Jamaica to rich Chinese parents. So nationally, that's confusing af. If it clears anything, they were both part of WHO. 

My mother was born in either southern China or Hong Kong. There's disagreement on this. Her father seems to be Canadian-born from Chinese parents. Her mother was adopted, but agreed that she was from a small village in Southern China where they had to leave my mom as a baby during war times. Her siblings are American-born.

With that shit in mind, I'm confused af. 

The TLDR; version of that is my parents came over to the U.S. at a young age. My father at 13 and my mom at 8 years old. (If anyone can parse out which generation I am in, let me know, because I don't know.) We only spoke English, and if there was any Chinese culture shown, it was during CNY (politically correct to be Lunar New Year). My parents found community in the Christian faith, but it's the kind of faith where they're bigoted and close-minded. Again, I still love them, but politics have to be put aside if I can even tolerate it. 

More recently in my life, I was officially diagnosed with Autism and inattentive ADHD. Being a cis woman (also married) who has been fighting against internalized sexism and racism, and recently ableism... I feel even more marginalized. 

Honestly, I'm not sure what to do with this, but maybe someone can suggest some things I can read about to help curb this loneliness? Maybe even a therapist? Does anyone have stories they want to share? 

I have interacted with other Asian Americans and have friends, but their experiences are more straightforward, including my spouse... i.e. they know their mother language and their culture is mostly intact, laced with American, and seem mostly okay with this. Most times, they look at my reactions like I'm a baby, which is fair. I am overly sensitive (mostly due to the Autism). And I'm here unraveling every month.","You’re normal. There are many others like you with more involved histories. You can say what label you’re comfortable with. Chinese American works and up to you if you want to detail the rest of your family history. 

---------------

Here’s how the Census defines generations:

> The U.S. Census Bureau uses the term generational status to refer to the place of birth of an individual or an individual’s parents. Questions on place of birth and parental place of birth are used to define the first, second, and third-and-higher generations. The first generation refers to those who are foreign born. **The second generation refers to those with at least one foreign-born parent**. The third-and-higher generation includes those with two U.S. native parents.

------------------


Not all Asians have more ""straightforward"" lives. On this sub, many others are also going through feeling not Asian, American, or Asian American enough. But remember we're not a monolith. No matter what, you're enough. 

Regarding your loneliness, it would be helpful to find a community, friends that you can connect with, hobbies you can enjoy with them, and media representation (books, movies, tv, music, etc) you see yourself in.

I'll also recommend some past threads with stories you may relate to, books, and therapy resources.

"Am I able to identify as both Chinese & Taiwanese?
My mother’s side is Taiwanese while my father’s side is Chinese. Taiwanese & Chinese people are Han Chinese so technically, I’m ethically Chinese. However, I think Taiwan & China have their own distinct cultures & history even if they seem similar on the surface. Plus, I don’t really want to leave out my mother’s side. Am I allowed to identify as both or would I be confusing people? Srry if this seems like a dumb question or if I’m phrasing it weird.

Thanks!","Of course you are! Why do you think you’re not able to? You can definitely say whatever you want, but in my experience, most non-Asians don't really get it. My mom is from HK and my dad was Singaporean, and I usually just tell people I'm Chinese because it's easier. I remember one time this white lady asked me what my family background was and when I told her HK/SG, she was like, ""oh! I thought you were Mandarin"
"Conformity or Non-Conformity to stereotypical Asian and Asian American values; why do so many continue to gatekeep or accuse each other of being white-washed?
Many of us have encountered the pervasive stereotypes that paint Asian Americans—or what is deemed ""authentic"" Asian culture—as introverted, conformist, and solely focused on academics. These assumptions not only oversimplify a diverse community but are also used within our own community to gatekeep what it means to be ""a real Asian."" Why?

I've personally been labeled as ""white-washed"" or ""too Westernized"" more times than I can count, usually for being extroverted, flirty, overconfident, defiant of authority, and craving the spotlight. My interests—sports, competition, partying, leadership roles, and public speaking—have often been seen as departures from traditional Asian norms. But here's the thing: my values don't stem from growing up in America. My sisters, born in Vietnam, share similar traits.

My mother, who reached adulthood in Vietnam, used to sneak out of her home as a teenager to study judo, in direct defiance of her parents' rules. She made it all the way to brown belt before she was discovered (she's standing proudly on the right in the pictures below). In college, she actively participated in protests—marching, holding signs, and speaking at political rallies. Later, she became a liberal college professor of literature at the University of Saigon.  My mother, the badass, is the most important influence on my life and is the one who taught me that the pinnacle of success requires you to be well-rounded: athletically, academically, financially, and romantically (**""văn võ song toàn""** (文武雙全)).

My father grew up as a street urchin, hustling and making money any way he could, before serving as a captain in the South Vietnamese military, holding significant leadership roles. He wooed my college-educated mother despite lacking an academic background.

His father was a smuggler who used his connections to organize refugee escape boats—you've probably heard of the ""boat people""; my grandfather orchestrated those escapes using his fleet of boats and ability to bribe and smuggle. I last saw him at 97, recently recovered from a motorcycle accident, still insisting on riding to show off to me, his grandson, that he was still cool and strong. He had four concurrent wives at one point and lived to 103.

So, I submit that it's essential to recognize that traits like extroversion or defiance are not exclusive to any one culture. This internal gatekeeping suggests that certain traits or interests are less ""authentically Asian,"" reinforcing narrow definitions of identity. While some Asians may more closely align with certain stereotypes, it's a mistake to suggest anyone is any less Asian for acting in opposition to these stereotypes. And why give White culture a monopoly on extroversion?

Furthermore, if being confident, gregarious, or non-conforming - or liking sports or art or socializing - helps you succeed in Western society, you don't need to feel like you're doing so at the expense of your Asian heritage or as assimilating. Why are only Asian people put in this box, while any other race can feel free to be loud or quiet, introverted or extroverted, as they please? Do it if you want to!  Hell, do it better!

I want to broaden our understanding of what it means to be Asian or Asian American. Embracing the full spectrum of personalities, interests, and values within our community allows for a more inclusive and authentic representation and enables us to take greater ownership of our identity. Let's celebrate and support each other's individual rights to define who we are beyond societal expectations.","Calling people white-washed because they are internally racist and intentionally trying to distance from their Asian heritage is one thing, but calling people white-washed because of their personality, looks, interests, or lack of certain ethnic knowledge/skills (e.g. knowing a heritage language) is just perpetuating Asian stereotypes and racism itself. You're so right that advocating for Asian American identity should be about expanding what's imaginable for us and breaking down stereotypes, not upholding them. White washed = we act American bc we are American"
"How do you emotionally process the death of a parent… when your relationship with them was cold, painful, or even abusive?
I’m 36, the eldest daughter in a very typical Asian family. Growing up, I internalized the script: be successful, get married, make your parents proud—especially my mom. But the older I get, the more I realize how much of myself I gave up trying to please someone who never treated me with real kindness.

To paint a picture:
	•	“One day you’re going to off yourself.”
	•	“I’ll ask your sister—she has money.”
	•	“It’s too late for you. You’re already 36.”

Those are actual things my mom has said to me. Every year, I enjoy being around her less. I barely talk to her now. I’ve developed an attitude—resentment, really—that I didn’t let myself feel before because I was too busy trying to be good enough.

My dad is different. Quiet, kind, emotionally distant like most men of his generation. He still talks like a boomer but I know he wanted more for me, and I carry that too—this eternal feeling of shame, like I never measured up to what either of them hoped for.

We don’t talk about feelings. When I’ve asked about what they want later in life, it’s completely transactional:

“We’ll leave you the will. Just burn our bodies. Don’t waste money on funerals.”

And I’m scared. Because I don’t know how to face the death of my own parents with this kind of distance between us. Especially my mother. How do you mourn someone who made you feel worthless? How do you process the death of someone you resent?

For those of you with cold, harsh, or emotionally dead parent-child relationships…
	•	How did you handle their death?
	•	What did you regret not asking or doing?
	•	Did closure come, or did it just hit harder when they were gone?

I keep wondering if I should try to talk to them more now—or if the damage is too deep and the emotional wall is just how it ends. Either way, I don’t want to be unprepared when the time comes.","I know our situations are completely different but I went to therapy for my relationship with my mom. My big cathartic moment was when I realized I wouldn’t be sad when my mom died. It’s a really hard thing to admit because society tell us we are supposed to venerate, love and uplift our mothers for their love and sacrifice.

But what if there wasn’t love and just cruelty, guilt and shame. It’s ok to let your anger, resentment or whatever you are feeling die with your mom. If you still carry those negative feelings long after she’s gone then only you and those you love suffer. Hopefully you can break free of the generational trauma you are suffering from.

I hope you find your peace. Crying in H Mart and I’m Glad My Mom Died are pretty big Millennial touch stone stories for those who hold contradictory feelings towards their parents, especially mothers. Check them out, they may help you"
"They remember to ask me for money but they forgot my birthday lol
I was raised abroad & so I don't know if this is just ""Filipino"" culture or not so I thought I would ask here. I visit the Philippines every 2 years or so and when I do, I come bringing pasalubong gifts that are designer and/or inconvenient to bring across the world. I was doing well at work and so over the last year, I sent a lot of money to my close relatives who asked -- it was at least hundreds of USD per person, at least when I was in a good mood to send or depending on who asked. I know it's just money and I shouldn't expect anything when I give it out (and I don't), I also know that the phone works both ways, I'm just appalled that **among all of my relatives in the Philippines**, **the ones who reach out to me whenever they need money or when I'm posting fun things on my stories**, who I also reach out to when it's their birthdays, **not one single person remembered to wish me a happy birthday**. 

Actually, for some reason, I felt like since I was growing quiet on my social media and stopped uploading stories, my cousins weren't replying to any of my messages anymore except occasionally when they needed help with tuition/prom/graduation/medication bills, that maybe I shouldn't post as much to see who would still reach out. This time, I stayed quiet around my birthday, and sure enough, no one reached out. Not a single person. It's just Facebook or instagram, I'm not looking for attention, I have friends here who are foreign-born or foreign-raised Filipinos like I am and so they can understand how I feel, but even one message from my actual family would have been nice. I'm supposed to go this summer to the Philippines and instead of using the money I would usually spend on gifts or giving it to whoever asks, I think I'm just going to use it on more travel. The problem is, it doesn't feel enough. I'm still so angry. I really want to speak out about it to my uncles and aunts and cousins but my parents say it's just how the people are in the Philippines. Is this true? Should I speak up about it or let it go and just forget it?

I want to add that one of the reasons I should ""let it go"" is because this family treated my mother very well when she had nothing. I was also a bridesmaid to a wedding, and generally this is the family that tours us around when we come over for vacation. I don't want things to be awkward but I don't know. Is there something I'm missing / am I being self-centred and is there something I should have done?","[deleted] Sounds like they're maybe taking you for granted and getting used to the one sided offerings. It is possible it could be an out of sight out of mind thing in the context to your bday. Either way, I think it'd be good to set boundaries though in the long run. Something like only sending money in actual emergencies or important events. Like minimum yeah you bring gifts sometimes because you live abroad and make more money than them sure but you're not gonna be a pushover and let them take advantage of you. Know what I mean? Respect should go both ways.

I'm not Filipino so I don't know how much this relates for you as well but the whole unconditional respect for elders thing in a lot of AA culture has rubbed me the wrong way for a long time. They expect me to greet them or be extra nice to them when they don't even show me the same courtesies yet they might get upset about it. Give me a break. Not greeting someone every time I came home or whatever doesn't mean I don't care about them. The same way they never greeted me when I came home doesn't make me think they didn't care about me. I was just giving back what I was given generally. I basically treat everyone about the same. Beyond the obvious of being family they're not special. That philosophy can also apply to your situation in a lot of ways."
"Does anyone know ways to know my culture better?
Idk if I’m doing this right, this is my first time posting so plz let me know if I got something wrong. But I’m looking for ways to feel more in touch with parts of my culture I’m ignorant to.

My grandma on my dad’s side moved from South Korea to America, when she got pregnant with him she gave him to his adoptive family. Though they were still close, his adoptive family erased EVERY ounce of both korean and indigenous (my grandpa on my dad’s side is indigenous) culture. When I was born, my dad abandoned me when I was 4 and remained out of my life for the most part. He’s got a lot of internalized racism, so he also erased all of our culture and refused me a chance to learn it.

I moved recently, and I ended up finding stuff my grandma had made me when she learned I was conceived. A silver bangle, christmas ornaments and some other things (a lot of the stuff my white step dad pawned or threw away before I ever got to see them again). Someone wanted me, she wanted me to know the country she came from and wanted me to know at least some of the culture she tried to preserve after moving to America. I want to know that part of myself, I want to learn the culture my dad’s family tried to erase. I have some memories of her when I was really little, but a lot of my childhood is blocked out for other reasons. I look EXACTLY like her, it’s uncanny. It feels like I’m missing out on a part or myself if I ignore the Korean (and indigenous) heritage I have, but I have no idea where to start because I only have white people in my life. I don’t know where to start, it would be a great help if anyone could give me advice? Sorry for the long rant but I really wanted to ask and I really appreciate it.","How old are you? Is taking a trip to Korea an option? This [video is pretty good](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fjIUd-PiMQI)

"School asking my four year old to wear deodorant 'like other girls her age'
The school pulled my husband into the building to ask him to have her start wearing deodorant like all the other girls her age today. I don't understand as she showers daily, doesn't smell and they refuse to let the kids play outside on the fenced playground. My daughter is four, I'm honestly confused and at a loss.","I don’t know any 4 year old that is wearing deodorant! Who from the school had this convo with your husband? Just some random teacher or the head of the school?? I’m baffled by this request, on so many levels. “Like all the other girls”?! I have a hard time believing anyone else is putting deodorant on their preschoolers. I can’t imagine that’s great for their skin, it is NOT necessary and I feel like I’d rather not have them all wearing scented deodorant. Also why the girls? Why wouldn’t it be all the kids? How does the teacher even know who is and isn’t wearing it? A smell check? 

I’d ask what the specific hygiene concern for your child is and then decline to apply deodorant to a small child. That is bizarre."
"I don’t like my kids. I don’t like being a mom
Hello, I have two kids. Ages 8 and 6.

I separated from their father two years ago after he up and left (turns out he was cheating- I don’t know how I was so blinded- anyway). I have them full time. with occasional visits from their dad when he’s in town.

The eldest has been giving me such a hard time that I genuinely do not like spending time with him. His younger brother is following his footsteps

I know it’s partly his age, partly not having a man figure, partly iPad/screen. He loves his iPad and Netflix/disney+. He’s generally a nice boy to hang with his friends. But…. With me… he’s an asshole.

And the burden of being alone, a full time corporate employee, still not over being cheated on (I know my ex got married this summer- so I am battling resentment), and my sons’ not following simple instructions is slowly draining all the love I have for them. It kills me to write this.

These boys were my world- I used to be the mom Jumping on the trampoline with them, running after them at parks, waking up at 6 am because I don’t want to miss 1 minute.

Now, they are a responsibility. Make sure they are fed and drop them at school. That’s it.

I am emotionally distant from them. They can feel it.

The behavior I can’t handle is the disrespect. The amount of times I have heard “I hate you” and “I wish you are dead” this summer is more than I can bear.

I always try to plan play dates, at least 3-4 times a week (during summer break). But getting them out the door screaming and shouting is getting on my last nerves. They don’t want to leave the house. I end up dragging them by their shirts to the outing. The eldest shouts and screams the entire drive about how I’m a horrible mom, forcing him to go out, forcing him to do things he doesn’t want, how he hates me, wishes I never existed.

Then I end up asking them 12736 times to leave the play area. Then my son would say “sorry I was mean”. But I just don’t care anymore. I would rather he doesn’t talk to me anymore.

Everything is tiring. I know it’s probably screen addiction. But without screens to distract him, I would go crazy.

The embarrassing part is my brother and his wife and my cousin look at me like I’m not a good parent when they’re on their iPads, then they look at me like I’m not a good parent when they’re having their tantrum.

I don’t know how to discipline. I don’t know how to make them follow simple instructions like brush your teeth and put on your shoes.

What angered me enough to write this post is that over the weekend, at my parent’s house (the whole family was gathered for the weekend), my kids woke up early so they sat watching tv while we were all sleeping (7 am) I woke up at 8:30 (it’s the weekend). Anyway I let them watch tv so I can drink my coffee, brush my teeth change my clothes (etc). I started telling them to turn off their iPads/tv by 9:15 and just go outside and play (this kept going). Later by 11 I gave them squares of aluminum foil and scissors and said “let’s make swords!! Or a robot!”. Shouts and screams like I had hit them. I kept turning off electronics and telling them to go play outside on the bikes, check the plants, etc. cue screams and shouts and tears. But when your son screams at the top of his lung and says the rudest meanest things infront of people, you tend to just want him to shut up and give you peace.

I gave up. Then when I was packing to go back home, they went outside to explore, and made a Huge fuss about going back home and that they wanted to check the ants and bugs outside.

I’m going out of my mind. I don’t want to be a mom.

I know it’s also probably resentment knowing that their father is living his single life while I am “trying” to parent and failing. It’s also them knowing how to manipulate the situation in their favor. But I don’t care if they spend 17 hours a days on screen anymore. They’ll live.

But the guilt is too strong","There is nothing like having to put everyone else first all the time, endlessly without an ounce of reciprocity to make you resent every hard thing you ever have to do. I'm so sorry, I can't imagine how alone and tired you must feel. 

You need to break down your problems into solvable bites. 

1. You are severely lacking in adult emotional support. How can you find ways to make other parent friends to commiserate with? It will sound impossible, but if you do 1 single thing, let it be this. 

2. Kids behavior In all likelihood your kids are struggling with losing their father too. I recommend family therapy, but the main thing is they've just lost their father, and if he can up and leave, well then that means you can too. You need to acknowledge that they might be feeling scared or sad, reinforce that you aren't going anywhere ever, and then model how you talk about your feelings in an honest way but don't let them stop you from doing hard things. 

3. ""I don't know how to discipline my children"""
"My 7 yr old doesn't appreciate my daily exercise
I'm scientifically classified as faticus Americanus. I was also laid off a month ago. So in addition to not eating anymore greasy gas station food I've been picking up my daughter after school by walking. It's 20 minutes each way.

A 40 minute walk every day and better diet has got 10 lbs off already. My 7 yr old is starting to complain. Getting her every day gives me motivation that would just be spent playing video games. She's not fat herself but has a small belly that could use the walk too.

How do I convince her that walks with daddy are a good thing?","Piggy. Back. Rides.

Carry her backpack.

Bring a scooter.

Bring a snack.

Have a funny story to tell her on the way home. 

Ask silly questions about her day. 

Draw a hopscotch game on the sidewalk on the way to get her and jump through on the way back.

Write riddles on the sidewalk for her to guess on the way back 

Chalk obstacle courses. Just want to add be very careful how you talk about and frame exercise and body size. 

She’s at a ripe age for eating disorders so be careful what you say in front of her, even if it’s about yourself. I’d keep any discussion about the walk to be about feeling good, efficient travel , enjoying time together etc and leave body size completely out of it. 

We go on walks with our kid because nature and being outside is very good for all of us. Great job with your health goals so far and modeling active lifestyle!"
"Daughter asked boy to homecoming, his parents said no
*Edit to add there isn't a dance. This is for the homecoming football game. Football and homecoming is a big deal here in the south*
I want to preface this with I completely understand where his parents are coming from and do not fault them at all. This is just my heart breaking for my daughter. 

My daughter(7th grade), asked a boy ""friend"" to homecoming. She didn't tell us that she was even thinking of asking anyone as she never talks about him in a romantic way. The boy said, ""Sure, why not?""

 Girls are getting asked to homecoming left and right and for the 2nd year no one has asked her. Everyone shows off their giant mums and garters on game day. This boy is on her cross country team and they sit next to each other in one class. Unlike many boys their age, he's always been friendly, nice, and funny. After asking if he thinks of her more than friends, she says he's like that with everyone and she doesn't think he likes her like ""that."" Her intention was as a friend who wanted to go to homecoming but didn't want to go with a gross and disrespectful boy.

This morning his mom let me know that the family agreed that he was too young to ""date"" this year and he couldn't go to homecoming/dances. He was aware of this and said yes anyway. The mom said he was very flattered and most likely caught up in the excitement of being asked. That said, the boundary is strict and he has to back out of it. Again, I understand and respect this fully! 

It's been a conversation with her friends that they've said yes to boys only to be nice. As a mom, it was my worry that he said yes out of feeling on the spot and not wanting to hurt her feelings. I small part of me thinks his mom is covering him on this part. Of course, feel bad thinking this way about it. She's not ugly at all but a little different in style(not sporty clothes)/interests(Korean stuff) than her peers. She isn't flirty and isn't as interested in non-platonic relationships as other girls. She's had crushes, and has told them she likes them, but none of them ever liked her back.

It takes guts to ask a boy out and I'm so proud of her for taking it into her own hands. Her confidence is my biggest worry. I was thinking of showing her the text the mom sent as it's neutral and kind. I haven't even responded to the mom yet as I'm still processing it.","Your daughter has told boys she liked them in the past, been rejected, and continued to do that and even ask a boy on a date.  I don't think you need to worry too much about her confidence in this context. Honestly, I'm pretty jealous of her self-confidence! I’d just show her the text and let the parents take the fall for it like they wanted to. You never know if they’re even telling you the truth and not just trying to tell you something you’d expect to hear to avoid a harder conversation. 

The reality is we never know what goes on at home"
"School Dropoff
My son attends a preschool as part of a larger school. 

They are not allowed to be escorted inside the gate so we see A LOT of toddler breakdowns with parents at the gate. Last year (as a 3 year old) it was TOUGH. We likely had more bad drop offs (screaming/crying, having a teacher carry him/walk him in) than good ones. 

This morning a young child was losing it at the gate. My son kissed me goodbye, walked over to him and just offered his hand. The boy took it, and they walked in together. About 3 steps in, my son made a funny noise and the other boy started laughing, and they walked hand in hand, laughing every step in to school this morning. 

I just stood there sobbing. ❤️","I hope you tell him how proud you are of him. That kind of empathy will serve him and the world in great ways. You obviously are doing a great job as a parent. Congrats, you’re raising a kid who is making the world a better place!"
"Help: FTM, 20 weeks pregnant & mom on opioids wants to babysit when baby is here
Hey everyone,

After years of trying and multiple miscarriages, I’m (36F) 20 weeks pregnant and expecting a girl in January. My husband and I are obviously thrilled, but there’s something nagging at me and that something is my mom.

My mom has histrionic personality disorder and therefore has issues with respecting other people’s boundaries. Like when I ask her not to mention my pregnancy to people I don’t know, she tries to post it on Facebook anyway. Or when I ask her not to buy me a million baby clothes, she does so anyway. Or sometimes it’s more serious, for example when I ask her not to smoke in front of me now that I’m pregnant and she does it anyway. That kind of stuff. Apart from this personality disorder she’s chronically on high doses of morphine for back issues and will drink wine with it in the evening, although she says ‘it’s not much’. She has a history of alcohol addiction when I was a child, so I’m very weary and don’t like to be around her at night.

Now the current issue: she’s made multiple comments on how she wants/expects to babysit when baby is here. My husband and I are apprehensive because of her opioid use and her breaking promises like not smoking around me while I’m pregnant etc. On the other hand: my dad is in assisted living with dementia and my in laws are deceased, so we have a very little ‘village’ so to speak. On the one hand she’s the only grandparent my daughter will have. My sister lives in another country and my husband isn’t in contact with his siblings.

What do we do?! Allow her to babysit short amounts of time? Just at our house? Or no babysitting at all and just visiting? Maybe when the child is a bit older? She commented on us getting an extra bed in the house so she can stay over all the time, so she’s very set on it. How do I set and enforce boundaries, or is that wishful thinking?

I know my main focus should be the safety of my child and not my mother’s feelings, I’m just lost how to go about it. Any experience or advice is welcome, also please let me know if you think I’m just overreacting - my upbringing with her alcohol abuse was quite traumatic at times, so it could blur my vision. I’m also looking to find advice in that regard: would others also not let her babysit?","I think the best way to judge whether or not a family member would be a safe babysitter is to ask yourself: If they weren’t related to me, would I feel comfortable hiring them to babysit given what I know about them? I would let her watch the baby with you around (doing chores, organizing, etc)

I wouldn’t let her babysit alone. If she doesn’t respect your boundaries with you around (smoking around your pregnancy), why would she when you’re not around?"
"I don’t know if I should be letting my kids walk home from school
For back story and context : my grandma lives in a duplex with us. She lives on one side, and we (me, my husband, and 2 kids ages 10 and 11) live on the other side.

Last year my kids were going to a school out of district. I wanted them to go to the one that is literally 6 houses down from us but my grandma and mom didn’t agree and ended up saying they’d pay the tuition for the other school and contribute in to driving them as they thought the out of district school was better. I ended up giving in as long as they kept their end of the deal. Throughout the year it became a fight because they no longer wanted to be in charge of driving them. (I couldn’t be there to drive them every day). So for this year I switched them to the school down the street to avoid more fighting. The out of district school clearly wasn’t working out and resentment was growing. 

Well, now they’re walkers. They seem to like it. I like it. It’s so much easier and I assumed my grandma would have nothing to anrgue about with me. However she’s still inserting herself. She doesn’t like that I don’t physically walk them. I did at first so they’d know what to do, but now Ive trusted them to do it themselves. I wait on the porch for them after school and every day my grandma has yelled at me about how I’m not doing it right and should be walking to get them. 

Today it came to a heated discussion because it was raining. I had warned my kids that it would be raining when they got done with school and had asked if they wanted picked up. They both said they were fine and that they enjoy their walk home alone so I just made sure they’d be dressed appropriately for the rain. My grandmother ended up leaving the house to walk down to get them with an umbrella for really no reason at all imo. It was sprinkling by time they were done. When they returned it turned in to a disagreement between her and I. That’s kind of whatever to me at this point and I’m not asking what to do about my relationship with her. it ended with me saying that maybe she should take a break from involving herself with my children since it’s clearly stressing her out. 

But now that I’ve had some time to think about what has been said to me I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing for my children. Like are my kids too young to be walking themselves? Am I being an inadequate parent by letting them walk in the rain at all? I just don’t know what to do or what the right answer is for us going forward.","Grandma needs to hush. Your kids are fine. Did I read that correctly, six HOUSES down? 

Without knowing the context of where you live, in my opinion, they are absolutely old enough to be walking to school alone. Don’t second guess yourself. 

Must be the Canadian in me, but avoiding a very short walk due to a bit of a light rain? Common. Kids here walk to school in -20C (I’m not exaggerating). 
 
What a wonderful opportunity you’ve granted your kids and they seem to like it, enjoy!"
"Former best friend turned the whole class against my son… how do I help him heal
It all started with one (former) best friend. He decided he didn’t like my son anymore, and instead of just drifting apart, he made it his mission to humiliate him. He would embarrass my son in front of others and slowly pull all the other boys away from him. And it worked. He loved the control, he thrived on it. 

By the end of last school year, my son’s whole group of friends had turned on him. The boys he felt safe and comfortable with — gone. Now he sits with kids at lunch that he doesn’t really connect with, just to have someone to sit with. But he misses his old friends so much.

He’s about to turn 13. This is supposed to be the time he’s finding himself and building those lifelong bonds, and instead he’s dealing with betrayal and isolation. It breaks my heart to watch him go through this.

How do I help him heal and move on when he still misses them so much?","/u/CoffeeTop9848, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"14 Y/O F wants to wake up at 3:45 AM for bus
Other parents, please help me out here.  My daughter wants to wake up very early because she says she ""needs that time to get ready and have a good day.""  She is refusing to wake up any time other than 3:45 AM.  And if she sleeps late because she sleeps through her alarm, she fights us in the morning about going to school because she didn't get to do her morning things.  She said whether or not we want her to do it, she will not wake up any later than 3:45.

Is this normal?  How would you handle this?

My wife and I are on the same page about 5 AM being the earliest she should wake up in the morning.  And yes, that also means that she wants to go to bed around 8 PM.","If she wants to do it, let her do it. My guess is the shine'll wear off after a week or two. It is currently a trend on tik tok.. high schoolers waking up at 3am to shower , blast music, do a FULLLLLLLLL glam like 10 step skin care, full Smokey eye, lip liner , hair in rollers..
Then body care, lotions, skin oils, skin glitter , perfume. 

It’s a whole thing.  

If your daughter has access to tik tok, this is possibly what she could be following."
"Should I take my daughter’s best friend with us to St. Barts?
So here’s the situation: my daughter is an only child. We’ve known her best friend since kindergarten, and whenever we go on family trips we usually bring her along. This summer we took her with us to the Wisconsin Dells and stayed at Kalahari for a week, and honestly, it made the trip so much better for my daughter since her cousins are all way older (high school and college age), and she gets bored around them.

Now we have a bigger trip coming up — we’re going to St. Barts. Everything is already paid for: villa, flights, food, excursions. I keep going back and forth on whether I should invite her best friend again. On one hand, it would make the experience so much more fun for my daughter. On the other hand, St. Barts is obviously a big luxury trip, and I’m not sure if it’s crossing a line to bring someone else’s kid.

It’s not a money thing for them. Her dad is in his last year of residency for neurosurgery, and her mom is a real estate agent, so they could absolutely afford to send her if they wanted. But when their family goes on trips — Disney, Florida, even a ski trip to Aspen last year — they always bring my daughter too, so it feels like it balances out.

My only concerns are: is it weird to bring another family’s child on an international luxury trip? Would it make things awkward if we cover everything? Am I setting myself up to always have to bring her on every trip?

At the same time, I feel like she’s part of the family at this point. We’ve known her for years, she’s a really good kid, and my daughter truly sees her as a sister. I just don’t want to overstep, or make her parents feel like I’m spoiling her in a weird way.

Would you bring the best friend along, or keep this one just family?",My parents brought my really close friend at the time (I was maybe 10?) with us to Hawaii and it was the best trip ever. I had so much fun going on a vacation and having a friend with me. I’m also an only child (I’m 28 now) I think your overthinking it and you could totally have this kind of conversation with her parents!
"Do your kids actually eat what you pack?
I swear I spend more time packing lunches than actually eating my own breakfast. This week my son came back with his entire lunchbox untouched… but then demolished a bag of chips when we got home. 🙃  
Do your kids actually eat what you send with them, or do they trade it away/ignore it until after school? Trying to figure out if I should keep battling or just give in to simpler lunches.",Maybe it’s time for them to pack their own lunches One of my kids always eats everything I pack. My other one it’s 50/50. He tends to talk a lot though and not eat so it’s not that he doesn’t like the food it’s that he just is too busy to eat. I’d say send at least 1 thing you know they will for sure eat so they aren’t hungry.
"When you're roadtripping with your kids
And you pass a semi, do they do the arm-pump ""honk-honk"" gesture to encourage the driver to sound off their air-horn?

My kids LOVE to get semi drivers to honk at them and keep a running tally of honks per trip, but my son said he mentioned this game to his friends and none of them had even heard of the arm-pump air-horn gesture.

So I put it to you, Redditors; is this a dying art, or is the air-horn pump still a road trip game in your family automobile?","Every kid I know does this. 

If we are at a roadside ice cream stand or similar, they stand at the road and do it to trucks passing by as well. Haha I love this question. We do a lot of road trips with our kids, but they don't know about the arm pump thing. Maybe I should teach them!"
"Coach didn’t put my boy in the game. Not even a single snap.
So my boy had his first tackle football scrimmage today.  He has been dreaming of this day and preparing for it for several years.  His genetics don’t carry him very far on their own, but like me, he’s scrappy.  He knows the game extremely well, he gets along with his teammates on and off the field, he has been to all practices, summer camps, conditioning…. Along with being a bit small, he doesn’t speak up for himself much, he is a people pleaser, so he draws very little attention.

Long story, medium, every other player got time, every. (it was a scrimmage). He was called up a couple times only to be turned back around by a field coach.  Needless to say, he is upset and frustrated by not knowing why.

I am trying to be thoughtful about how I handle it, or if I should stay out of it, or so on.

I have always been hands off with my children enabling them to solve their own problems.  I’m supportive but I try to guide them through the probing using their own actions.

There have been a couple of times I was torn on my decision to jump in or not, even in hindsight.

I recognize that this is likely just an oversight, but man, 1 out of say 60?  

As I see it, here are my options:

Stay out of it and support my son, from sideline and at home.

Coach my son and prepare him to meet with his coach to inquire as to what happened.

Set up a meeting with coach myself

Email coach to directly

Those are all I have come up with, please let me know what you think I’m missing or ideas/approaches. 

Oh, I forgot to mention, I have yet to personally meet the coach.","Your child can and should ask the coach “What can I do on and off the field to be ready to go in to the game? I’m excited to play!” Enthusiasm and work ethic can compensate for skill and natural talent over time. Your roll here is to help your son be the most coachable player he can be. Hope he gets a chance soon. How old is the kid?

Is the league recreational or competitive?

Are there any guarantees of playing time?"
"Looking for advice on leaving my daughter home alone
For context, my husband and I are going through a very difficult time in our marriage and will require both marriage counselling and individual counselling. The only time we are both available at the same time to attend our twice weekly joint sessions are on Saturdays and one evening per week. We also live at home with our 8 year old daughter (who will be 9 in 3 months).

We have limited support and no family/friends available to provide childcare. Money is very, very tight, but we do ok enough to not qualify for any assistance outside of using food banks. There’s no more room to cut our budget and we’re already run ragged and exhausted from both picking up overtime to make ends meet. We sometimes struggle to make the mortgage but we get by.

We’ve sat down and thought of every possible way to afford a babysitter for a couple hours a few times a week and the money just isn’t there. I know that sounds crazy to most families who aren’t teetering the line of poverty but we just can’t make it happen.

We’ve come to the conclusion that the only way we could make it work would be if we could leave our daughter home alone for the 2 hours we would be gone. We both feel safe about it, she is a very trustworthy and rule-following child. She is mature enough to follow all safety rules put in place and we would make sure all doors and windows are locked. We would be able to leave one of our cell phones home with her and have my mom call her every 15 minutes to check in (mom is a 4 hour drive away but can call police if my daughter doesn’t answer the phone). My daughter is comfortable with how to call 911 and how to leave the house in the event of a fire/emergency. We would only be gone during daylight hours and would have designated times to check in with my mom to make sure nothing happened to my husband and I (car accident, etc).

There is no legislation where I live that gives a minimum age for being home alone. The three of us all feel comfortable with this. I guess I’m just looking for opinions, is this ok to do?",Can you do a test run to see how she handles it? My mom started having me stay home alone frequently at ten and I was very anxious despite it being safe. Maybe she will feel grown up and love the independence though. Does she have any school friends you could try to get to know so she could have playdates with them? Ask the therapy office if they have a spare room she could be in. That's what my office has. Some have it and some don't
"Drop off birthday party
I’m planning a movie party for my 9 year old. We live in a small 2 bedroom apartment and wanted to rent the clubhouse we have in our apartment complex for the party but it’s not available currently, which is why I have to host at home but due to limited space, I’ll have to do a drop off party. Problem is, school just started and they swap students every year so my daughter ended up with all new students in her class. It is also mandatory by school to invite everyone in the class. She has around 16 students in her class and even if half of them shows up to the party with an adult, it would be impossible to accommodate.

I’m wondering if anyone would be comfortable dropping their kids off at someone’s house they don’t know.","Maybe unpopular opinion, but why invite kids from her class if you/she hardly know them? I would just ask her to name 2-3 closest friends (from this year or last year) and have a party with just them. A movie, bowling, something like that.  I’m sure the school would allow that as long as she didn’t pass out invites at school. 

Personally I would also find it hell to supervise 16 9 year olds who I don’t even know. Some of those kids could be real wildcards. Is this a private school? Because if it's not, then they can fuck all the way off about requiring you to invite the whole class. 

It may be that they won't let you distribute invites unless you do, but by the time a kid is 9 (3rd grade?) she should have the friends she wants to invite, and you probably have a way to contact them, right?"
"Pre-K kid in ESL program being punished by losing recess - is this normal?
I’m in Texas, and my 4-year-old just started Pre-K about 3 weeks ago under the ESL category. I recently found out that she’s already had recess taken away at least twice - once for jumping on her way to recess and another time for not listening to instructions.

I only learned about this now, not from the teacher’s daily reports but from my child and another parent. I’m truly heartbroken realizing she’s been going through this without me knowing.

At this age, recess is one of the only times she gets to relax, play, and connect with classmates - especially as she’s still learning English and adjusting to a whole new environment. Taking it away feels harsh.

I honestly think there are better ways to teach kids how to follow instructions than isolating them from play.

Is this common practice in Texas public schools? Has anyone else experienced this, and how did you handle it?","My kid reported this to me in Pre-K. The teacher, when I reached out, had a perfectly logical, much less severe explanation involving kids having to sit briefly on the sidelines until they calmed down. There were several instances of goofy misunderstandings like that.

Clarify with the teacher. Hey /u/Candid-Worker-1377! It looks like you might be new here.

"Almost 3 yo Behavior
My second born will be 3 in December. He has always been very touchy and needs constant physical stimulation like jumping on me or even trying to hit. I mostly deal with it like I would with my daughters. My problem lately is that I’m uncomfortable with his constant touching. He’ll hit/squeeze my butt and grab my boobs. I tell him very sternly to stop and not do that. My husband thinks I’m overreacting and he’s only 2. And yes, obviously there’s no malice in what he is doing, he doesn’t understand. But it makes me uncomfortable because it’s the way my husband touches me. Makes me feel yucky the same way I do when a dog sniffs my crotch.

"What are some early red flags with your kids friends parents?
I like to get to know my daughter’s friends’ parents and try to establish friendships with them so I know what sort of family my daughter is getting involved in. When meeting your kids friends parents for the first time, what are some early red flags that have turned out to be true of people you don’t want to be friends with?","First time I dropped off my daughter they mentioned they were going to go pickup pizza. I said “sure that’s fine”. 

At pickup time with my daughter “Daddy! I didn’t have to wear a seatbelt in the car!”. Red flag for me are Parents who complain about teachers, coaches, tryouts, life etc all being against their kid or victim mentality. That tends to result in kids who can do no wrong and are incredibly entitled."
"6 year olds' best friend is my least favorite friend... advice please?
My daughter hangs out with a little boy (7 y/o) who lives behind us. The more they have played the more I realized his influence is very impressionable on her. 

He is very competitive about EVERYTHING. Boastful. Plays unfairly to make sure he wins. Everything he has and does is better. Extremely disrespectful to authority. The list goes on. 

I am aware this is an insecurity & it is my assumption he may be slightly envious of our family dynamic as it is very different to his. His parents seem very absent & we are very present in our daughter's life. 

ANYWAYS - I try my best to help my daughter set boundaries with him here at home & any time spent together I am nearby to try to teach & influence better social choices between the 2. I can see a change in her attitude if she has spent any amount of independent time with this friend. 

This school year they are in grade 2 & 3 - meaning they are on the same playground. She has been spending both recesses with this friend & I can tell by the way she behaves once she comes home. She wants to spend more time playing outside with him after school but I have been redirecting to other activities/ideas as to limit the time they are spending. 

Today I told her I'd like for her to try to make new friends as she is in a class with a lot of different kids than she's been used to having in her classes.... Is that OK? Would it even be OK to reach out to her teacher/school staff to encourage she plays with other kids during recess, too? 

I feel bad being negative about her best friend but this has been about a year and a half and not much has changed in their dynamic. I don't want to tell her who her friends should be & i try to model/communicate what good friends look like & are but she looks up to this little boy immensely. 

Any advice? 
Thanks in advance from a worried mom.","I was like your girl. Until I went to uni I always looked for friendships with stronger more assertive people. I don't know why but I think it filled something that was missing for me. My family was loving and warm but also a bit chaotic and not very decisive. Bonding with stronger personalities allowed me to stay in the shade (where I was more comfortable) but also experience that self confidence, even if second hand. 

You can definitely organize playdates with other kids just to expose her to different dynamics. Also, give her some lines she can use to boost her own confidence, sometimes kids just don't know how to do that Move. 🤣"
"My 16 year old son is currently dating the daughter of a guy who used to harass me.
So, this dude had a serious crush on me from when  we were 15 till I was about 27. He was never dangerous to me specifically but he would occasionally send me long, drunken semi-incoherent messages and attempt to talk to me in bars and whatnot. Getting married himself didn't even stop him, he didn't really stop until he had kids. I don't want to stop my son from seeing her (he has had a big crush on her for awhile). However, I really don't want to have any contact with her family. Maybe he's changed, but I don't want to have any contact with him. How should I approach this?","Man you need to move to a bigger town I mean how much contact are you really going to have? A couple of texts here and there maybe? 

Maybe just establish that your husband is the one they should go to if they need to reach out for something. If it becomes serious, which who knows at 16, you’ll need to revisit but it’s likely not something to stress about"
"My son does well with one on one but his school can’t give it to him
My son has ADD and takes medications to help with grades and behavior. I have noticed he needs me to be with him to do homework. And i voiced this to his teacher once I got his grades. He currently has two Ds in Math and reading. He has an IEP and the teacher said they support him multiple ways. This is what the teacher said “Good Morning, he does get plenty of help he gets pulled by the reading interventioist, he gets pulled by resource every tuesday and thursday for about 30 minutes. Whenever we do independent work he also gets help from me he usually gets pulled to the back with other students so I can help him on his work and I also simplify the questions for him. For example if the assignment is solve questions 1-10 I usally let him solve questions 1-5 only because het gets help from me. 

Sometimes he will refuse the work. There are times where I give him things to write on his paper or sentences to copy and I have to walk around to help other kiddos and when I come back he still has nothing done. Sometimes it is like pulling teeth with depending on the subject. I really have to be on him. He is a hardworker but there are days where he will be a little bit defiant. 

Progress reports are also not his final grade, their quarter 1 grades come out September 19 so he will get plenty of time to fix his grades and have more completed work(: 

Let me know if you have any more questions or even some homework for him to practice (:”


Do i find a school that specializes in ADD? I am low income so maybe i can get a scholarship? Do I ground him until he stops being defiant or is it possible he has a learning disability? I don’t know what to do. They are going to do an IEP meeting per my request and I guess i just want to prepare. Are there more resources for my child and his way of learning? We are in AZ if that matters.

Thank you!","Can they do an evaluation for a learning disability? If they can I would absolutely ask that they do it as it may open up the possibility of more resources or more frequent intervention. It may also be worth looking into private schools (in the meantime) that can offer you a scholarship if they are able to better meet his needs. 

Please don’t punish him. If it’s a learning disability it’s not something he’s doing “wrong.” Punishing him would send the wrong message and won’t work. Hi! How old is he? Do you see these behaviors at home? If so, how do you manage them at home?"
"My ASD son unintentionally hurt child on school playground
Today my 10 year old came home shaking and crying immediately off the bus about him and other students throwing rocks at a tree trying to kill a spider.  Then one of the rocks hit another student causing major bleeding and for extra caution student had to be transferred by ambulance.  Apparently there was- lot of blood. After the injured student was gone they talked to many students 8 names came up including my son. Quickly my son admitted to being of the kids throwing rocks. He was extremely concerned for other student, showed signs of remorse and visibly shaking up.   I reached out to the school first (surprised they didn’t do it first? ) they explained situation and also notified me the cameras did not show him physically doing it 

They did not want to punish him however they are keeping him in the office tomorrow all day because they are worried other students might show anger towards him & cause him added anxiety. He also gets to be with the counselor a lot tomorrow which will be helpful.    They understand and completely agree that this wasn’t something done on purpose.  

However I can’t help but feel so sad, anxious , frustrated for not only the kids parents but the entire situation.  My son is already bullied a lot because kids don’t understand autism. I’m worried about getting sued by this kids parents even tho there’s no video evidence.  They plan on having a 4th grade assembly tomorrow about this entire situation (obviously not including my son because he will be in the office) that the student (my son) did not mean to do this and this being a good lesson for thinking about your actions. 

I’m just beside myself about this whole thing.   

Has anyone been through something similar and how did it work out for you?","Aw I don’t have any advice for you but it sounds like you raised a good boy.

"Am i being unreasonable by saying no extracurricular=no phone for my 11 year old daughter?
Hi all,

I'm the dad of a wonderful 11 year old daughter that just entered 6th grade. Mom and I have been separated for 9 years. Daughter spends close to equal time with both of us. 

My daughter has been struggling in school the last few years. Last year I got her diagnosed with ADHD at the end of the year and got her on an IEP. She certainly has ADD- but a lot of her struggles have been due to not putting in the effort- likely because of the ADHD. 

Well its a fresh start this year in middle school. And for the first time, she is properly medicated. I got her a phone last year because there were two days a week where she would have to be alone for about an hour. But I got a massive promotion and now work from home. 

I told my daughter before school started that she would have to be involved in some kind of extra curricular that has a GPA requirement in order to have an unlocked phone. 

Daughter agreed- but when school started she said it wasn't fair and complained to her mom. Her mom got extremely upset abd said I was being unfair and that she doesnt want our daughter doing extra curricular because she wants her help at home with the baby. 

Mom also moved 1.5 hours away and I'm sure the commute is also an issue- even though I said I would do all the driving. 

I backed off a little and said if she wants her phone- she will need to have a very high GPA with zero missing assignments. And her phone would be locked until she proves she is doing the right thing. 

Mom called this rediculous and said she would just buy her a phone if I don't relent. 

I don't feel like I am out of line here. In my mind- a phone for an 11 year old is not a necessity. It's something extra. And if she wants it, then she should put in extra effort. 

To my daughter's credit- she has been doing amazing in school. Though its only been about 6 weeks. But she really is out of chances with ne when it comes to school. 

Now I am the bad guy for having standards- which I am fine with. But I am frustrated and disappointed by both of them. 

Am I taking crazy pills? Or is there something I am missing about my position? 

Just to note- an accusation Mom made is that i am trying to ""force her to be an athlete"". But it's made it clear from day 1 she could choose any extra curricular she wants. 

Please help me out here.",[removed]
"Field trip 6 years old on their own…
We notified last minute on Wednesday morning that our kids are able to attend a field trip to a local fair in town for about 2 1/12 hours about 5 blocks away from school. Teacher can only take 6 parent volunteers to chaperone. There’s 22 students. I volunteered with my permission for me and my kids today since they were handed out yesterday. I guess I was not one of the first parents to reach out (I’m assuming the other parents who were picked personally messaged teacher to volunteer) 

So now my 6 year old will need to ride in another parents vehicle to the fair and back to school and I also have to provide a car seat for them or else they will not be able to go. My son is so excited to attend the field trip he’s been talking about it since they found out.

Teacher shares a message with the parents letting us know she understands our kids are still so little and wishes we can all attend but are not able to because the fair will be closed the public at the time. So as far as I know it will only be our kids on a field trip and not sure if any other school will be going as well…. I’m a little hesitant now on sending him but I also want him to have fun. 


What would you do??","The only thing weird to me is the transportation. Our school system only allows busses for things like this, no private vehicles. However, I would let him go. He will be in the care of multiple trustworthy adults. He'll be supervised. Let him go."

"At what age did you start to discipline your kids and how did you go about it.
My son is 1 y.o, so far I've been saying now when he attempts possibly harmful behaviors while also removing him from harming himself.

Even as he gets older he may still only respond 50% of the time lol To discipline means to teach. It doesn't need to mean punishment!

So, at 1, you physically move them away from what they're doing with a super short (three words) explanation of why, and an instruction of what TO do.

So, we designated a particular spot on the kitchen as the ""safe spot"" where it was away from the stove or the path to the stove or sink. So then if I needed to open the oven, or was an instruction I could give. Then we could use, ""ouch, hot! Stay in safe spot.""

Or ""water for dogs! This is your water."" Or ""you can play in this water!"" And set them up at a plastic tub on the floor."
"how to deal with my own reactions and teach better reactions to my kid
I know that i frequently react poorly to a lot of disappointments. I am not great at modeling patience. Not being able to quickly work through my emotional response is a huge issue for me. I desperately need to work on this but fully just do not know how. Talk therapy in the recent past (2-3 years ago) has done nothing for me, I promise I have tried that route. I know that I am the problem. I need some resources for ME to work on this and model better reactions.

In the past couple weeks, since my child (5 M) started kindergarten at a new school, he has greatly increased his similarly poor reactions to minor things, but the new issue is his threatening other kids. He knows that threats are unacceptable. I've just learned that, at school, he's been trying to actually hurt other kids now when he gets upset. He has tried this with me before, and I have told him directly that it's ok to be mad, it's ok to be upset, it is NOT ok to hit people or use your hands, and that he needs to keep his hands away from others, and that he needs to say ""I am mad/upset/disappointed/frustrated because \[reason\]."" His teacher tries to redirect him and have a safe spot for him to move through his emotional response, which he eventually does, but it just takes a really long time. We are all explaining EVERYTHING to him. **He knows the expectations.**

In the past couple weeks, he has been acting particularly unpleasant, uncooperative, refusing to listen to basic instructions (hold my hand in this parking lot, timer's up and it's time to leave the playground, sit down and stop jumping on the couch bc you just jumped ON ME, please walk at the pool so you don't slip \[result: he slipped and fell HARD on concrete. Did not care, got back up.\]). 

Yes, I follow through with the stated related/natural consequences (e.g., ""you will sit in the car until you calm down and you're ready to listen, and miss out on things if you don't listen to me to stay safe,"" and oh look, he has to sit in the car now. We have left playgrounds bc he will not stop doing something super dangerous. See also: please bring your water bottle home from school so we don't lose it for good). 

And, my reaction to his escalating refusals to listen have been... poor. I start out fine trying to keep it casual but authoritative, increasing to ""hey, I said \[you have to XYZ\],"" but by the fifth time I am BEGGING him to please do the thing, I just lose my sh!t and yell at him. 

Oh, also, he does not do ANY of this with his dad (my husband), just me! (And yes, I am fully ""honored"" or whatever that he knows that I will love him regardless of his sh!t behavior, it's still not acceptable.)","/u/lolbye424, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"How did you handle your LO's second birthday while heavily pregnant?
I know that lots of people like the two-year age gap, so I'm hoping someone out there has some ideas! My kids are going to be 25 months apart, so I will be HEAVILY pregnant by my older son's second birthday. 

Some background, my first babe was a 36 week preemie after my water broke unexpectedly. Almost not a preemie, sure, but that now classifies all my future pregnancies at an increased risk for preterm labor (which runs in my family... no one has full term babies). I've already visited L&D twice, and while I'm not on ""bed rest"" orders... I am on ""do as little as possible and stop everything that causes contractions"" orders. So toughing it out is not a medically sound option.

I'll be 35 weeks by my son's birthday. My husband is severely overworked while taking care of all of us. He's a trooper. What did you guys do to still make your older kid's second birthday fun while being heavily pregnant? Any idea for what we could do? Help with the mom-guilt because I physically can't give him the same birthday I did last year?","A two year old will no concept of what a birthday is and doesn’t need any fanfare. Buy them some gifts, give them some cake (or whatever) and leave it at that. Have a bigger one next year. Skip the full on party. Send your husband out for some pizza (or whatever food from kid favorite place to eat at). Get a cake from the grocery store and a packet of balloons (Blow them up at home and play Keepy zippy bluey style). Maybe get him a new toy from the store or maybe wrap up something he hasn’t played with in a long time from home. If you have family nearby, invite them over to keep kiddo company for his birthday. This year is probably not the year you need to be going all out."
"Help! Struggling to pack school lunches
My daughter is almost finished with week 2 of kindergarten. Her preschool was half days, so she always ate lunch at home. Now, I am packing her a cold lunch 5 days/wk and already feel like I'm out of options. Primarily struggling with proteins to fill her up and starches/fiber that is not just crackers.

I have a very hard time getting her to eat anything other than snacks (and I've tried presenting lunch as a collection of snacks - she didn't buy it). Her kindergarten is a nut-free facility, and I usually rely on trail mix and peanut butter to get her something filling at home but obviously those are out. 

She will NOT eat cold cheese, eggs, lunch meat, soups, pasta (unless it is just plain noodles), most mixed foods like casseroles, etc. 

She WILL eat pizza, grilled chicken, tacos, steak, salmon/fish, rice, roasted potatoes, homemade muffins and bars...but I have a hard time packaging warm foods in containers that will keep the heat in AND that she can open independently at school.

Most ideas I can find on blogs for cold school lunches are lunch meat or cheese-based. I've resorted to cold pizza and sunbutter sandwiches for 2 weeks now. I try to put in some lunch meat roll-ups just to see if maybe she'll try new things, but no luck. I worry she will be hungry and have trouble focussing in the afternoons...help!","honestly, take her to the store with you and have her test opening various containers. I have found some flap style lids in thermos style containers that my kids find easy to open. Harder for them to close though... Will she eat cold shredded chicken? Wraps made with that might work. My boys don't like sandwiches, so we usually send leftovers. Finding a thermos my child could open in kindergarten was important. The best success was with the Omiebox. It is not the end of the world if they eat the same thing for lunch every day during the school year. Focus on things she will eat, school lunch is not where you want to force the ""eat it or starve"" mentality. 

My kids eat the same packed lunch every time. It keeps them full and focused for learning."
"Audio books for 8 year old?
My son is currently reading the Harry Potter series. (He reads a book, then we watch the movie). It’s something he wanted to read, and obviously we are happy he’s reading legitimate novels. 

He will be getting an Apple Watch next week. And we have an old pair of AirPods he will have. He’s on the bus for about 25 minutes each way to school. 

Debating getting him the audiobooks but I know it isn’t nearly as good for his brain as him actually reading?","Audiobooks are still great for development. Check out the Libby app and let him choose a book. You're a brave soul to send airpods with your 8 yr old on the bus. My daughter is 16 and loses misplaces hers all the time. That being said, audio books on occasion are fine. In addition to that, would you be able to download podcasts? There are some fun educational kids ones."
"Books for supporting 4 year old -parental preference
Hullo! Looking for recommendations of your most well-loved books on supporting kids around the age of 4. My daughter is my world - love her so much! And she has a strong preference for me over my partner. This creates  lot of upset and leaves both myself and my partner exhausted. Looking for books that may touch on this. AND/or books that offer good grounding tools and cool playful exercises to support my sweet sensitive (and STRONG lol) kiddo. When she’s upset there is lots of kicking. We do support her to try and stop it out or growl. As well as lots of validation and play etc. But would love to have more tools!! Thanks!!","4 is a great age to implement boundaries! Keep it short and simple, but it’s a great age for her to start learning that you don’t always get your way and how to handle those emotions You’re going to need to put boundaries in place and stick to them if you want things to change.  Figure out what you want partner to do and stick to it even if it means you have to leave the home.  It can be such a severe reaction that this is the only option at times.  You can share with her the schedule and prepare her for it while validating her feelings staying firm with the plan, whether it’s alternating tasks or whole nights.  

Physical aggression is never okay and that needs to be addressed.  I’m sure you’ve figured out that trying to explain to a kicking four year old why we don’t kick doesn’t work.  Short sentences and consequences you follow through with, that is never appropriate behavior to get your way."
"I’m so confused on the reasoning for putting kids in sports these days.
From time to time, I’ll come across content like “let kids be kids! Your kid isn’t making it to the NHL, NFL, etc..”.

“It’s all too overwhelming for the kids. It’s all too competitive” 

Now I seen a post saying that we SHOULDN’T be putting the kids in sports due to these reasons, and everyone in the comment section agreed saying “yes we should be having our kids play outside, have family time, and play with friends.” 

And I’m all for family time, but at the same time it confused me. What do they think the reason is behind putting kids into sports? I never put my kid in any sport with the imagination “he’s going to become a PRO! He’s going to make it to the ____!” 

No. I come from a poor childhood and never had opportunity to join anything. I felt happy I could put my kid into things to keep him active and have fun. 

My son (who is now 10 years old) was in karate for 4 years (twice a week) with soccer once a week. 
Now he’s looking into joining competitive soccer and leaving karate. 

I was also interested in putting him in piano maybe once a week. 

So that would be two training sessions of soccer in the week, one game on the weekend, and maybe some piano lessons once a week sonewhere. WITH school as well. So maybe no piano but I do think it’s great for kids. 

But now I’m feeling guilty especially after seeing these posts. 
No, I don’t have expectations my son will become a pro. I honestly just want him to focus on school.
Is that supposed to be the end goal for these sports?? That’s what some parents make it feel like. Like we are putting them in these sports with the idea of them making it big or being special. 

I just put him in there cause he likes playing soccer. I think it’s a good idea to stay active, and maybe make friends. 
I put him in karate cause I think martial arts are good for people, but I’m letting him leave because he feels done after 4 years and wants to try competitive soccer. 
I wanted to encourage some piano cause he loves music and I think it’s nice to have that knowledge and it builds IQ and focus. 

He plays a TON outside. He has neighborhood friends and they play in the yard all day. 
We do family trips and play video games together. We eat together every night and talk about everthing. He gets tons of sleep. 

But I’m feeling a bit guilty after seeing some of those posts and everyone agreeing. 

Yes, sometimes it all feels very busy and we’re on the go go go, but is that no ok? 
Should we hold off on piano or competitive soccer? Should he just do regular soccer (one day a week)? Is competitive only for those who want to be “pro” or for those parents who think that’s what their kid will be? Or is it for the kids that love soccer and want to play it more seriously and more often?","Getting physical activity is good.  Healthy competition is good.  Learning to work together as a team is good.  Overall there's a lot more benefits than drawbacks to a kid participating in sports. A lot of sports in the US (particularly swimming and football) are a full-time job from middle school on, with training at least 6 days a week, often multiple sessions. Others have effectively mandatory travel leagues costing 4/5 figures annually per kid.

Those are the ones people get upset about, because those kids have no life outside that."
"Birthday party
Is it wrong to not throw my daughter (turning 4) a birthday party? We haven’t had a party since she was one but we will be in Disney the week before her birthday. I’m just worried she’ll be disappointed. I am going to decorate the kitchen for her birthday week. I do plan of having a big 5th birthday party next year. Tell me I’m not a bad mom!","You don’t need to do a party, but of course do something special to acknowledge it. Nope, not wrong at all! We don't do parties every year. After age 5, she would let us know if she wanted one or not, and it's still the case today at 16. We celebrate her birthday in whatever fashion she wishes."
"I love being a mom but man is it hard
I love being with her but i need down time. I miss her when we’re apart but i long for time to myself after too long together.

I think she’s wonderful, perfect, smart, curious, sweet. But also demanding as heck. Loud. Obstinate.

I want her to be brave and fearless but im so afraid of her hurting herself. 

She’s almost 18 months. I am exhausted. She’s a low sleep needs kid - late bedtimes, early mornings, short naps.

My husband is wonderful. We went through a rough patch but he has been very available and extra helpful the last few months. Im proud of him and his parenting skills.

Im exhausted. Im happy. Im always stressed. I have a jumble of conflicting emotions. I love being a mom. I love my daughter with every cell in my body. I an exhausted and touched out and over stimulated.

This is life and love and i am okay with it. I am happy with it. I am tired from it. But not of it.

Can anyone else relate?","Yes. Mom of a 3.5 year old. Sounds exactly like yours. Legit cry tears when we are apart yet I do wish for some alone time and my bed back!! But this is the season we are in and I try to remember the days are long and the years are short. Love her with all my being even if I do wish she didn’t talk so loud challenge every thing I say and kick me all hours of the night haha. Hugs mom!! I couldn’t have written this better myself! It’s so hard to convey these feelings especially to people who aren’t parents— I fear saying the negative parts because I don’t want anyone to think I don’t love my son, don’t love my life, or that I’m not extremely grateful for it. But the exhaustion, perpetual worrying, longing for a break but never truly getting one is immensely difficult. Motherhood brings about the most complicated mixture of strong emotions that I’ve ever experienced, and it’s a whirlwind.

Sending you all the well wishes!"
"My son keeps saying he doesn’t want his daddy to come home. What do I do?
Recently my 3 year old son has started telling his daddy to go away when he gets home and throwing tantrums screaming he doesn’t want his daddy to come home and that he needs to go to work. I have tried asking my son why his dad needs to go to work and why he doesn’t want him to come home and I haven’t really gotten an answer other than daddy needs to go to work. I talked with my therapist about it today and she asked me to have him draw our family. I tried this but he didn’t want to draw anyone and just scribbled across the page. Which was fine but this is breaking me heart and I need answers. Please ask questions and give me advice! 

For background information my husband 23 and I 25 don’t have a perfect relationship. We are in couples and individual counseling but I don’t know how much it is helping. It is helping me figure out what I want and what I will put up with but I don’t think it’s brought us closer together.","Is daddy coming home by any chance the event that happens right before it’s time for 3yo to get ready for bed? Is there circumstances where you and your husband are arguing or does it get physical?

Is dad often strict or difficult when he gets home?

Do you (totally normal and understandable) need a immediate break from parenting when your husband gets home and your kid doesn’t like that?

Basically, what’s going on in the relationship between you and your husband as well as your husband and child? 

There is something that kiddo does not like and it might be a simple as preferring time with you or more concern like dad is always yelling. With the limited information it’s hard to tell."
"Tell Me About Year 2
I'm a first time mom to a beautiful nine month old boy and I can't believe he will be turning one in less than three months.  

I feel guilty saying it, but I look forward to having the first year in the rear view mirror.  I love my son to death, but I am exhausted from not having any semblance of a life outside of working and parenting.  I understand that this is a very short blip in my life and that as he gets older, I will have more time and capacity for my other interests as well. 

Anyway, how do you all find the second year in comparison to the first?  Do you find it any easier as your child is able to move on their own more easily and is able to start communicating using some words at least?","Toddlers are absolute chaos. While they can move more, they don’t stop and they have zero impulse control or comprehension so 90% of the day is just keeping them alive. Communication improves some but with that means they start to develop opinions and bigger feelings/ emotions that they can’t quite understand. My toddler keeps me mentally drained.  

I have a love/ hate relationship with the toddler stage. I love watching him learn and try new things. We get to do a lot more. But I miss the simplicity of having a baby (I also have a baby lol). With the baby I can grab clothes, pack up, go on. With my toddler? He’s a very independent guy… so I need at least an hour to let him very slowly dress himself and for him to argue with me over clothes, socks, shoes, water cup, etc. before we can even leave the house. Pros and cons lol. When my kids turned one I felt relieved.

When they turned two I felt proud.

When they turned three I finally started to feel a little sad because I would miss two.  That has continued every year since.  (My oldest is eleven.)"
"Child Classroom Placement Gr. 4 (ontario, Canada) Frustrated.
Im actually shocked, as I didn't think I'd be a parent to get frustrated with the school system or decisions of administration. 

Today was first day of school for my son who's 9. He's in grade 4...

Last year he was in a 3/4 split class, and now again Is in the 3/4 split... Whatever,... Is what it is... 

However, he has three other grade 4s with him.... One other boy... With the entire rest of his cohort in a straight grade 4 all together...

I'm pissed for him. How does he pull this straw and why would a board be allowed to create a split class with only 4 kids on the one side? How will they get a fair amount of teaching? How are they expected to grow socially. 

I'm debating calling the school, or just going right to the board.. 

Am I overreacting?","Yeah, this happens. They have too many kids for a straight 4, and have some “leftover” kids to make up a split grade. The kids that go to the split grade are usually the ones who are either more independent and able to work well with less supervision, or are struggling and could do with a bit of a refresh on some topics. You know which side your child falls on. I remember being in a class like this at that age. It was fine tbh. We still had recess and lunch with the kids our age and we made friends with the older grade just fine. a lot of the time we still had lessons with the other class. We got to socialize with both age groups and I think we ended up being more mature at the end of the year."
"Almost 18m old daughter tantrums giving me anxiety
My daughter started tantruming from about 10/11 months and just when I thought they couldn’t level up anymore they do. She has started having fits that last 30 mins, is this normal? Screaming, thrashing about, kicking, rolling on the floor, stiff arched back, growling, head twitching. A lot of the time in public. No attempt at distraction, snacks, comfort, breathing, being talked down helps (if she could even hear me over the top of her extremely loud screaming - people have even commented on how loud she is). In fact it just infuriates her more so I end up just riding it out and if we’re near the car I will attempt to get her in to ride it out there. Some days she will seemingly tantrum the entire day with a short break before the next meltdown. I’m also having to hold her outward facing constantly as she no longer can even look at the stroller.

If you holding her or the stroller is triggering a tantrum, she's likely seeking to be independent so she can explore. My now 3 year old couldn't stand being restrained at this age.

"Conflicted on choice of preschool!
Looking for advice! My daughter (recently 3) was at the same daycare from \~1.5 yo until early August, 3X a week. We really liked the daycare, particularly the director and assistant director (who was also our daughter's first teacher there and just wonderful with the transition from at home to daycare), but something came up with the Toddler 2 lead teacher. Specifically that there was ongoing conflict between her and the assistant teacher which  the director was very aware of and working on. In addition we learned some disturbing stuff about the lead teacher's husband - people's partners' views are not necessarily their own, but I can't imagine his beliefs aren't something he shares at home and she's still with him. We had always gotten kind of a ""weird"" vibe from this teacher and we ultimately made the decision to pull her from care and not have her move up to their preschool program because it was causing us so much stress.

She was home for about a month and during that time we toured another preschool (School A), as well as the former school's newly opened location (School B). School A did not have an immediate opening and put us on a waitlist, while School B did have an opening and my daughter started there this week. So far things are going well - the energy in the preschool room is good and while she had some normal tears at drop off today she's come home happy both days and I was feeling a lot of relief.

Here's the issue. I just received an email from School A saying they now have a spot open and my daughter could start in a few weeks and is asking us to make a decision by tomorrow. My first gut feeling, the immediate feeling was to say ""no,"" but now I'm feeling conflicted and looking for thoughts/perspectives. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons of each by considerations:

**Cost:** School A would allow us to have our daughter there 3X a week, which is a schedule that we really like, but we'd still have to have to pay for 5X a week, which wil end up being **$800 more a month**. We could swing it, but it's a lot of money!

**Distance/commute:** School A would be a 20-25 minute drive each way. School B is only a 7 minute drive each way, which is obviously amazing.

**Outside space:** School A has a massive playground and a school garden which is amazing. School B has just a smaller playground which is fine but obviously love having my daughter having space to run an play.

**Curriculum:** School A definitely has a more defined curriculum and there's much more discussion of educational philosophy etc, but I don't doubt that my daughter would learn and grow at School B. She's a very smart and curious child and at 3 I'm also not overly concerned with learning, with a capital ""L"" - I do believe that at this age play and learning to be a good citizen of the world by interacting with other people should take precedence.

**Vibe:** School A largely caters to a local university's faculty.students so there is a lot of cultural diversity since these families come from all over, but my sense is that there is significantly less SES diversity. A good friend's son who previously attended my daughter's first preschool just started at School A and has communicated that the style is a bit less ""warm"" and more focused on independence (for example: asking how her son likes to be comforted and when she explained that at home it's hugs and cuddles they said ""we have a calm down corner for children to self regulate in""). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just a different approach. In addition, School A is a true preschool - only 3-4 year olds while School B is also a full daycare. While there is a preschool classroom they also care for infants and toddlers.

Sorry for this incredibly long post - I'm stressed!","Girl, respectfully, are you trying to take your daughter out of a school she’s already started at to pay a ton more money and drive further away?? 


(I’ve had 4 therapy sessions this month stressing about which school to send my 3 year old to so I’m not even judging) If she’s doing fine in her current school and you don’t have any negatives I wouldn’t take her out. 

I had the same exact thing happen to us, and decided to keep her there and she thrived (she’s now in first grade) 

We put my son in that daycare because of the same factors you listed."
"How many Apps does your kid's school expect you to install?
My son just entered Junior High School, and I have kind of been flooded with app download expectations. 

There's an app for the grade book. Another for athletics. Another for band. Another for the bus. A teacher has an app for her own class. The PTA has an app. And Parents chat on GroupMe. 

How many Apps does it take to be a parent now?","I have the grade book app and the instruction platform app. I don’t like downloading a bunch of stuff and junking up my phone, so I download them all initially and then delete what I don’t use. Sounds about right —"
"Night terrors?
I’m looking for advice on my daughter (almost 3y, only child).  I believe she is having night terrors but they seem to be happening during the day as well.  A little backstory- she is terrified of bugs.  Terrified.  Any and all bugs.  I fully blame myself for passing that fear on to her as she has definitely seen my reactions to bugs, bees, etc.  I’ve been trying to be more mindful and remind her that bugs are nice and they have the right to be here just like we do.  

Two days ago, she went to go get onto her bike and I heard her start screaming bloody murder.  Turns out, a wasp was on her handlebars and it stung her pinky finger.  I stayed calm, picked her up & brought her inside.  We put an ice pack on it and a bandaid (no stinger visible) and I gave her a snack and she was good to go.  She continued to talk about it though.  For example, when my SO got home from work the first thing she told him was how a bee stung her and that it wasn’t very nice.  SO told her it was probably an accident and that the bee just got scared when she put her hands on top of him and that the bee was just protecting itself.  

Unrelated but we recently got her a toddler tent with an air mattress for when we go camping.  We set it up in her bedroom a couple of nights ago hoping she could sleep in it here and get used to it before we go camping.  The first night, she did GREAT.  Slept all night in it, told us she loved it and wanted to sleep in it again tonight (last night).  

We put her to bed as usual, asked her if she wanted to sleep in her crib or in her tent, she chose her tent.   I read her favorite book, we rocked and talked as usual and I laid her in her tent.  

Just as I’m starting to doze off, I hear her start SCREAMING like I’ve never heard before.  We went bolting into her room to find her swatting her face and hair still screaming.  She was saying “there’s a bee!! There’s a bee in here!”  We took her out immediately, my SO checked the entire tent, took everything out, etc.  Nothing.  No bees.  We finally got her calmed down, told her everything was okay and back to bed she went.  Not even 5 minutes later, same thing.  We go back in there, this time she said there were ants crawling on her.  Checked the tent, same thing. Nothing.  

I calmed her down, we rocked in the rocking chair and I planned on rocking her to sleep then putting her in her crib instead.  As I’m rocking her & she’s dozing off, all of a sudden she scrunches up her eyes and starts swatting her face again and crying screaming saying there’s ants/bugs on her.  I told her there’s no bugs and she might just be having a bad dream.  She was clearly visibly distraught so we went downstairs to the living room and made a comfy sleep spot on the couch.  She had a hard time falling asleep but she finally did and there were no more episodes.  

This morning, I’m getting ready for the day and as I’m in the shower, I hear the same scream coming from the living room.  She comes running into the bathroom crying saying there’s ants on the couch.  I told her to stay with me in the bathroom and let me quickly finish and then we can go look together.  we walked out to the living room and I asked her where they were.  She pointed to the couch and said right here.  Nothing.  I decided to get creative so I found an old spray bottle, filled it with water and told her it was magic bug spray to keep them away so we misted the living room, the couch, her bed, basically anywhere she wanted to spray it.  She wanted to spray our cat too but I said no 😆.  

Last night, I was sure that she was having a nightmare/night terror but since she is also having episodes during the day, I’m concerned.  Has anyone dealt with anything like this before? Thoughts? Advice?  I have a call into her ped just to ask for their opinion, but I have a feeling they will say it’s normal for her age but I just want to know how to help her, she was so upset and it broke my heart.  My mom and SO think the bee sting really messed her up, and it gave her a valid reason to be afraid of bugs because one hurt her.  I don’t know, sorry for rambling.  I am sleep deprived and worried.  TIA for any and all advice. 

TL;DR- toddler having nightmares/hallucinations that bugs are crawling on her, things around her when nothing is actually there.","Aw poor sweet girl! As someone with apiphobia, I completely empathize. 

This doesn't sound like night terrors, which is a sleep disorder. My son stared having night terrors at 3, and then ""graduated"" to sleepwalking around age 5. With night terrors, it's usually a very disoriented child, sometimes yelling/hallucinating, but they are asleep (and very difficult to wake) and do not remember the episode afterward. While every child is obviously different, we couldn't even go in the room when my son was having terrors because we would become part of his hallucination and he would freak out.

 It sounds like your child is having nightmares that are waking her up, which is understandable after (what I would consider) a traumatic event for someone her age. Maybe there are books that could help, about bees and/or being stung and afterward? /u/PersonalRaspberry361, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"Need help with my words - 9yo son
Hey! I’m at a loss and would love some opinions. Lately I have found myself saying “I don’t care!” While arguing with my son. These are minor arguments, the daily grind kind of things, like doing homework or starting nighttime routine. 

For example, I will say “okay, 7 pm! Time to get in the shower.” And I’ll be met with “one second”/“in a minute”/etc. For context, we both have adhd and while I’m willing to be flexible in how things get done, I’m not flexible on when they should be done (within reason). It’s very easy to get distracted and all of a sudden that “one second” has turned into 15 minutes. 

He will argue that whatever he’s doing takes priority over what I’m asking (usually a video game but really anything he’s doing) and I’m not going to engage in a back and forth so I’ll say “I don’t care! We need to do x,y, and z”. 

Because he’s still in a literal phase he is taking what I’m saying to imply I don’t care about anything at all or anything concerning him which is far from the truth. I want to get my point across without making him feel that way. Any tips?",[removed] Try telling him 5-10 minutes in advance. “In 5 minutes we will get in the shower”. Set a timer an follow up. Shut off computer if he does not come with you.
"Parenting is basically Sisyphus-y
Every generation starts from the beginning. Every generation fights with bath/toilet/vegetables/whatever. Every generation needs to learn everything from the beginning. The best thing parents can do is to ""guide"" -- which is a pleasant way to say ""drawing lots"".

I'm really getting tired of all these. I hope I can have robot kids. Much easier to handle and much more pleasant to communicate with. Since my child is not going to be the next Napoleon/Einstein/Whoever, it's easier for both sides to have an orderly life.","Except instead of pushing a rock we are ""burdened"" with wonderful little human beings. Days may bleed into one another, but I'm sure glad my kids are more communicative than a giant stone. Makes the sisyphus-ness of it all much more rewarding. Well some stuff about parenting will never change.  Siblings fighting, potty training, nursing/feeding.  But in other ways, we got it easier.  Running water is awesome lol.  And many times, we end up doing what our parents and grandparents generation did because it has merit.   I found out not scheduling my kids for a load of activities made our evenings so much easier.  So this is what it’s like to toss our kids to go bike or go play or go read a book."
"Packed lunch for school
Has any had issues with what they’ve packed for their Children’s lunches? My kids 6 & 8 both are VERY picky eaters. I pack what I know they will eat or at least snack on. My daughter normally wants a pb&j, some chips or crackers, some type of peanut & applesauce. My son just wants sandwich pepperonis (No bread), Doritos or crackers, applesauce, & maybe peanuts or something else. They both usually get apple juice but they’ve asked for them little small bottle colas the last 2 days. Don’t jump down my throat for giving them soda that bottle will last them all day & usually still have 1/2 the next day. 

Anyway, I was told that I needed to pack my kids lunch different & no soda. When I asked why & where is that in the policy they became annoyed & said “We follow the USDA healthy schools lunch guidelines & soda makes a mess.” 
My reply was that’s fine that the school follows that guideline & procedure except that doesn’t apply to homemade packed lunches. I also explained that they only eat certain things & most things are hot foods & something I’ve cooked. I then looked at the school lunch menu & the Al la carte menu has chips, cookies, ice cream & some other snacks on it. So, what is wrong with what I’m putting in their lunch if they can buy junk anyway? 

To add to this I found out you’re not even allowed to bring them anything at lunch. Like if I wanted to bring them something hot or McDonald’s or whatever. Nope absolutely NOT happening. They don’t even want parents in the school. It’s very weird.","A soda at lunch for 6 & 8 year olds? Yeah, most schools aren't going to be cool with that. And no, dropping off a hot meal is a distraction. I've sent my daughter with a thermos or insulated Bentgo box if she wanted hot food but won't eat the hot food from the cafeteria. It's pretty standard. I can't imagine a kid having coke in their lunch. Our schools wouldn't allow that and your kids are far too young for that anyway. 

I'd accept the policy as is. No McDonalds makes sense too, IMO. It's pretty distracting for one kid to be eating a happy meal while the rest eat school lunch. I can see teachers not wanting to deal with that."
"Why can’t we let kids eat?
Maybe this is just a “my kids school” kind of problem but it honestly breaks my heart! I have a child in Kindergarten this year, and the other day another mom was asking me if my child had complained to me about not having enough time to eat lunch. I told her she hadn’t, but their lunch AND recess time is a combined 35 minutes so I wasn’t surprised others were having problems. But today, when I picked up my daughter I asked her how her lunch was (today was mini corn dogs which she loves), she said “It was good but I didn’t have time to eat my banana. It was so short” and it made me so sad 🥺 she had to wait in line for her lunch because she had school lunch, and then sat down, and didn’t even have time to finish her food (food we pay for, not to be a karen or anything lol.) The school day is 7 hours, why can’t they make lunch longer? (And before anyone asks, they can’t dump their food and go straight to recess, the teachers excuse them to recess and then everyone has to go at once.)","Assuming you’re in the US, the CDC guidelines for school lunches is a minimum of 30 minutes for LUNCH, not including recess and a minimum of 20 minutes of seat time. That means all children must be through the lunch line and seated with their food for at least 20 minutes. It sounds like your school is ignoring these guidelines altogether. I would get other parents together and go to the school pointing out this blatant disregard for what is best for your children. 

These are guidelines and not laws, but ignoring them is still dangerous to the wellbeing of the students. Parents have power. Demand better for your kids Dang.  Our kids get half hour to eat and half hour to play.  Then another half hour in the morning and a half hour in the afternoon."
"Learning to read
Any advice on navigating the whole “my kid is learning to read” stage? My oldest is five. Preschool has started her on the process, but I’m not sure how to explain reading in a way that makes sense to a small child. I try to teach her how to sound words out, but I don’t think my delivery is clicking—and I end up frustrated.

I love reading. To me, it feels magical. How do I help my daughter discover that same magic without losing my patience?

Any advice, tricks, tips, programs, or early reading book series?","Read to her. Lots. 

Occasionally, point out the large capital hey at the beginning of a chapter or section and say, ""ooh, look! SSSS! SSSSSSswan!""

And otherwise don't worry about it right now. Reading teacher here with a 6yo.

Read to her every night. 

Be enthusiastic about reading yourself but don't put pressure on her. ""Oh, I love to settle down and read with you! It's so fun to share books and tell stories. It's like the best thing in the world!"" As she starts to pick up words, enthuse! ""Oh, wow, you READ that word yourself! Reading is totally the best thing, you are so lucky that you're starting to get it, etc etc""

Point to the words as you read them. You don't have to run your finger under EVERY word, that gets old, but sometimes I would point to recognizable words like a character's name or pick a few key repeated words (like ""woof woof!"" in Biscuit books or the word ""cat"" or ""fun"" in The Cat in the Hat. If she starts to get annoyed or frustrated by this, lay off. Books should be fun!

Listen to audiobook stories for vocabulary development; it just adds to the hours she's being ""read to"".

If you don't watch any TV, ignore this, but if you do, put the captions on every single time.

Point out words in your environment, especially for stores or places she finds memorable"
"4 year olds..
What is going on with 4 year olds? Or is it just me who has a feral one?

Someone told me once that this was their favorite age, but I find myself on edge constantly as my daughter develops her confidence (which I love) and I’m just trying to keep her safe and ideally not get hit by a car or kidnapped lol. I’m trying to lean into the silliness, but there’s only soooo much I can do while also getting the things that need to be done, done! (My expectations are low - my house cleanliness is at the bottom of our list so it’s not like I’m trying to overdo it, I’m just trying to do our basic day to day tasks)

How are parents handling their ultra silly 4 year olds who think everything is funny/a game? I’d love to not constantly ask her to stick by me at the grocery store or fight her when it’s bedtime (crying in tired)","All I have to offer you is solidarity. I don’t remember my sons being so free spirited at age 4 but my daughter definitely is. No matter how much one on one time I give her, it’s never enough. She wants constant attention and my only relief is her going to the grandparents house with her cousins. She starts prek4 tomorrow and I’m excited for the time away from her so that my brain can actually finish a thought. And yes, I do feel guilty for feeling this way. Wish I was one of those moms that love spending 24/7 with their kids. I find after age 5 things calm down a lot. We refer to that time as when our kid was a fournado 🫠 

I don’t have help for bedtime because we’re still struggling with that at 5, but for the grocery store, it always helped us if we gamified outings. Like we’re grocery inspectors and I need you to study the foods and I’ll mark down what’s good and what’s full of aliens. Like it can be total nonsense, but harness the silly to your advantage when you can."
"Daughter didn’t make cheer - please talk me down
My daughter (13f) cheered for her middle school last year and tried out again for this year’s squad. She found out today that she did not make the squad this year, but not only that, she was the ONLY returning cheerleader who was on the squad last year who did not make it. This is the part I am most upset about. So not only is she incredibly disappointed, but she’s embarrassed as well that she was singled out. There are new coaches this year with new standards, and I realize she’s not guaranteed a spot just because she was previously on the squad. It just seems unfair and I’m so mad at these new stupid coaches (jk) watching her cry with disappointment.  She doesn’t know I am mad. Please help me replace my anger over middle school cheerleading with some rational thoughts and words of advice. Thank you! 

Edited to add - she was given feedback from the coaches. It was that she needs to work on her jumps.","Ask the coaches what she could do better and train for next year. This is an important lesson for her and showing your frustration or meddling can lessen its impact on her life. Yes, it’s difficult, but kids need to experience difficult things in order to grow. I promise as long as you help her face this with a positive attitude and an opportunity to improve, she will 1. Get over it and 2. Learn from it. Rejection is redirection! My daughter was cut from volleyball her senior year. Only person cut, and she played since 7th grade. It was crushing to her but I didn’t step in. She ultimately realized she was not planning on being a professional volleyball player and that ending her high school career might be a blessing in disguise. She put her energy into cheer and found a different passion,"
"My 15 year old son is extremely risk averse.
My son is 15 and ever since he was little, he has been extremely risk averse. I haven't been able to get him to take normal age appropriate risks. He afraid of anything unfamiliar. He can't swim, ride a bike, skate, or sit in high up seats at stadiums. He also won't go on amusement park rides. I have tried encouraging him and patience, but nothing works. I'm worried about the social impact that this will have on his life. As his peers get older, it seems like he falls further behind them because of his fears. I also think it's harming his confidence not to try anything new. Any suggestions?

BTW, he does not have any developmental disabilities.","Is he seeing a therapist for generalized anxiety? My eldest is fairly risk-averse, but your son seems to have taken it to eleven. Have you considered therapy to help him? Not knowing how to swim is actually MORE risky than learning to swim!"
"Funny how their brains work
I was trying to tidy my room and I had all my clothes out to be organised and my daughter was getting in my way over and over and over. She was offended, and rightfully so, when I told her to ‘get lost’ so I told her to ‘get found in the living room’ and because she thinks that’s hilarious she actually listened to it.

"How are we handling bullying these days?
Edit 2: The response from the other mom was so wonderful. ❤️ It really opened the door for some honest conversation and sharing of support. She was grateful I told her and assured me this is something they want to address with their son. Thank you so much for all your responses! They really were so helpful. 

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind and wise advice. So helpful to get some outside perspective on these things. I did go ahead and send the message and am hoping it doesn’t cause any major awkwardness. I agree with what several of you said: if it were my kid, I would want to know. 🤷‍♀️ 

Original post: I’ll try to keep this short… my son (8) had a best friend (9) who lives a couple doors down. They spent the better part of a year running back and forth between each other’s houses. The 9 year old recently became friends with some ten year olds in the neighborhood, and the whole dynamic shifted. My son desperately wants to be part of the group and tries to fit in, but all they ever seem to do is pick on him. It’s been a slow slide all summer, but I feel like we’re in bullying territory now. They sent some mean spirited messages to my son on his watch phone out of the blue yesterday (telling him he’s not cool, telling him to come over and play but they weren’t really at that location, sending messages of nothing but laughing, etc.) A couple times, they walked by our house, saw my son, and screamed “it’s him!! Run!!!” And then ran away laughing. In recent weeks, I heard the former best friend tell my son that he didn’t want to play in our “stupid ugly house” and another kid tell my son he’s “a loser who no one really wants to play with” while the others stood on smirking. My son spent the better part of yesterday sad and hurting. 

The question: Do I tell the neighbor boy’s parents? I only know the parents of the former best friend, not the other kids. We’re friendly but not friends. Below is the message I’m thinking of sending. (Names changed of course.)

“Hey Sarah - I wanted to let you know we had a bit of a tough day yesterday. Henry (and I think Hunter) sent some mean spirited messages to Anthony out of the blue on his watch phone. A group also walked by our house a couple times and if they saw Anthony, they would scream “There he is! Run!!” And all run away laughing. This is coming after a couple weeks of me hearing them say several mean things to him when they didn’t realize I was listening. It’s starting to feel like it’s drifted from normal kid squabbles into more targeted bullying. It seems that they don’t want to play with Anthony, which I will help him navigate. But if you could talk with Henry about giving Anthony some space, that would be helpful. Anthony has asked to remove Henry from his watch phone list and I’ve told him not to chase the neighborhood kids around anymore unless they explicitly say they want to play and are being kind.”","If my children were the ones doing the targeting and bullying another child, I would greatly appreciate receiving that message so I could address it. It was calm and clear without attacking anybody. Bullying is so hard to navigate, my 9yr olds have been on the receiving end and it’s heartbreaking to see. Sorry your baby is hurting right now ❤️‍🩹 Dealing with the situation rationally, frankly, it is good to talk to the parents, as the situation is no longer just a natural dispute or quarrel between children, but has reached the stage of bullying or intentional abuse. Your message is clear and calm and focuses on behavior, not on the child."
"HIGH interest book recs for 6 year old boy?
My son (6) is in 1st grade and has to read for at least 10 minutes every night. I love that this is his homework and I myself am a huge reader, but he is so uninterested in trying. The book has to be extremely high interest for him AND also easy enough to read. He can easily read 3 letter short vowel sound words (bag, get, hot, etc.) and basic sight words but compound words or strange vowel words (even short words like ""one"") scare him and he gives up easily. I do push him through, though. I want reading to be FUN for him, not torture. I am hoping that some ultra-high interest books might help him want to read more. 

I am careful about the type of media he consumes, but at this point I would consider anything if it got him to read. I'm fine with potty humor if he actually reads the words himself!

Do you have any suggestions? Thank you!!","You could try graphic novels. From what I understand, they’re really good for beginning readers since they help with visual literacy. Your son might find them more approachable than regular books, and the artwork is fun. Dog Man, Cat Ninja, and PeaBee & Jay have all been hits, but there might be some geared even more towards younger readers, too. Elephant and piggie!"
"Identity crisis with kids leaving?
My daughter is in her final year of high school and my boys are a sophomore and a junior. 

Has anyone else become panicky at the prospect of their children flying the coop?  I can’t be the only guy to go through this, right?  

They are great kids and I know I don’t stop being a parent because they enter a different stage of life.  But I guess I am scared as to what comes next?  I will be working part time at that point and will not need to if I choose that route.  The two biggest things of my identity will have ceased to be defining of me, (being a fireman and raising young kids).  

For reference I am a 52 year old, divorced man.  Any wisdom or coping strategies are appreciated!","Same situation here. Keep in mind they're becoming independent because you raised them right.  


Now is the time to start looking into investing in yourself more. Do whatever you wanted but never had the time.  Good luck. I'm a 63yo single dad.

yeah I worry a bit. My daughter is 18 and leaving to do further school  in China in about 2 months...she will live with her mum.

My son is 17 and I don't know what his plans are yet...but there's a chance he might leave to go to uni in another year.

I'm 63 and the kids make me feel tired.  All the same I know I will miss them when they are gone.

I knew it was coming of course."
"1.5 y/o won't let anyone hold her
My child won't let anyone hold her. Maybe 5% of the people we're around she'll eventually warm up to and let hold. In new situations, she isn't super friendly and is very clingy to us. We plan to put her in preschool when she turns 2 and I'm so nervous because not many people outside of my mom watches her.

This is my second child so it's not my first rodeo but I don't remember my son being this resistant to new people. I understand they feel safe around us etc. I am a very bubbly person that's always saying hi and hugging people, friendly and I'm definitely trying to model all of those behaviors in front of both kids but for some reason no matter how much we display it or even encourage/talk to our kids about it, they are both so shy. My 5 y/o understands these convos and obviously my 1 year old doesnt.

I guess I am just asking for advice on how to get her to open up more and be more friendly as she gets older? We've always been her primary caretakers outside of my mom so it's just making me feel so uneasy that she won't adjust.","Every toddler is different and her behavior is completely normal. She just has a high level of stranger danger, which honestly isn’t the worst thing when you think about it. 

My toddler is the same way as your daughter. But after some spending more time with somebody he will open up more. You can meet your daughter’s teacher beforehand to let them know your concerns, but caring for clingy toddlers is nothing new to them. 

During the first week, consider doing a phase in week. For the first day, you go in with her into the classroom for a half day. The second day, you drop her off and leave, but still pick her up for a half day. The third day and on, drop off her off and pick her up at her scheduled time. Feel free to modify this structure, it’s just an example. 


Lastly, if you haven’t started doing so, start communicating to her often about her starting at daycare. Tell her everything about the new routine, and how she is going to have so much fun at school with her teacher and friends. This will help prepare her a little bit on what to expect. It's okay if this is just who she naturally is. She's a separate person from you, and demonstrating your personality will not change hers. Not everyone is bubbly and huggy, even if the folks around them are. We called our kids the cat and puppy. The older one, the ""puppy"", was always up for socializing and snuggling, the younger one would prefer to come to you if and when he was ready for attention, just like a cat. Maybe you just have cat kids."

"Should I discuss girlfriend/boyfriend concept with my 5 year old?
Here lately it seems like everyone is asking my kindergarten son if he has a girlfriend. My friend with a 7 yo came over and said “ooo do you have a gf yet? My son has two he holds hands with both of them ..” my son answered yes I have lots of girl friends and I intervened and was like oh just friends who are girls and he said yeah. Then today after school he came home and said he had a girlfriend and my husbands first thing he said was oh did you kiss her and I about lost my mind. He is simply saying he has a girl who he is playing with. He has never even been told what a gf/bf is and doesn’t understand the concept of romantic relationships. Everyone thinks they’re being funny asking this and it’s really making me upset. This boy is trying to figure out how to be a 5 year old and tie his shoes and put his clothes on right, worrying about people liking him should be the last thing on his mind.

So now for my question. Should I sit him down and explain that when people say boyfriend and girlfriend they are talking about someone who you like and want to hold hands with/be around a lot. I can explain that it’s usually grown ups who have bfs/gfs and when adults ask about that they are just being silly because kids don’t have real relationships. This whole thing is just really upsetting to me maybe I’m being dramatic 😂 

I had a bf in kindergarten and specifically remember everyone asking about my bfs. Then I spent the next 20 years trying to get boyfriends and revolving my life around them and tying whether or not I had a boyfriend to my own worth. Maybe I wouldn’t of done that if my dad wouldn’t have always joked about me having boyfriends and bragging about it to his friends like it was cool his daughter was growing up. The same exact thing our friends do with their kids currently. 😐😐","Big no. I actually find it so weird that adults do this. And don’t get me started on old ladies who call male babies their boyfriends 🤮

Provide pointers along the way, but ultimately it’s out of your hands. It’s stressful, and you don’t need to be supportive of him. Always be supportive of her. I married my high school sweetheart.

My husband's sister also married her high school boyfriend. I think they started dating at 16 and are now 32, married with kids. We have old friends who met at 14 and are still together in their late 30s. It's not super common but it's not unheard of, especially here in the southern US.

A real life example from today's meet the teacher event, her new teacher said ""Hi Jane (not her real name)! Are you excited for school?"" And her response was ""Buddha is in the car!"" Her stuffed animal that I wouldn't let her bring inside. It's like she's not paying attention to social cues and conversation. I'm constantly having to redirect her in social situations.

She had preschool last year 3 days a week so it isn't like it is an unfamiliar setting, we also attended church there weekly.

When people introduce themselves or another kid says hi to her, she often doesn't respond, I have to direct her by saying, ""Jane, so and so is speaking to you, say Hi Sam, and she will quick look up and say 'Hi Sam' and then go back to looking away or whatever she was figeting with.

She seems to be okay with her cousins, who are older. But it isn't very conversational, more like statement speaking and mostly they're running around playing hide and seek or chase or something physical. Not sitting at the table talking. 

 We had a speech evaluation done last year after parent teacher conferences and it was brought to our attention that she was repeating herself- a simple questionnaire starting with what's your name, how old are you, etc. Then when asked what's your favorite TV show, and where do you live, she either didn't understand or know the answer, because she repeated 'my name is Jane' and 'i am 3 years old' for those questions. She also gave answers related to what she had just been doing- what's your favorite activity with your family? Grocery shopping - she had been playing grocery store in the classroom, what's your favorite food? Eggs. She was specifically playing grocery store and with the eggs, the teacher told me.

The speech evaluation came back fine for 3, the evaluator didn't have concerns since Jane was using the right context, plurals, ing etc. and also answering questions one on one perfectly normal. The lady said if after 4 you have concerns let's do an in class eval, as the bar is set much higher at 4. She turned 4 the last day of school! So I filled in her new teacher with my concerns and once we're back in the routine of things, if her new teacher notices anything off she is going to reach out and let me know so we can arrange the in class evaluation.

Our preschool teacher last year kept me in the loop for the rest of the year. Jane is soft spoken and will answer 1 on 1 or when directly asked but never participates in a group shout out the answer kind of thing. I noticed at their holiday performance she wasn't singing along or doing the hand motions and stuff. But she will do that sort of thing at home. As I reread this post it sounds like ""oh she is shy!"" But I guess in my gut I worry it's more than that. Especially because my gut about something being wrong with my younger son, was confirmed. He was diagnosed back in March.

I guess I am wondering what is ""normal"" for being shy and what is a cause for worry about things like attention and focus issues, neurodivergent social issues- her little brother is level 2 so I'm hyper focused on anything being 'off' to make sure we don't miss anything and she gets support if needed.

Are/were most of your 4 year olds having conversations and paying attention to adults and/or other children enough to go back and forth on their own? Again it isn't 100% of the time but it is enough to have me worried. At a church pot luck last Sunday, a child who was kust over 3 was telling me her favorite Disney princesses and things she remembered from the beach this past summer. On her own, unprompted. My daughter has never spoken like this. And no that child didn't have any older siblings. It makes my heart hurt to think she could be behind and hindered from making friends if she can't keep up socially.

Any similar stories, advice, what have you, I'd love to hear. Thank you<3","Hey /u/jujubeee23! It looks like you might be new here.

"Straw cups and baby spitting it out
So my son is almost a year old and whenever I give him water he drinks a bit and starts spitting it out. He knows how to drink from a strawcup cause whenever he is very thirsty he drinks normally. I just started transitioning from nursing to whole milk and he does the same with milk.

Does anyone have tips on how to fix it? Also if your baby rejects whole milk all together, what are other options?","Totally normal don't make a fuss about it and he will soon stop. Hey /u/Odd-Hope-8681! It looks like you might be new here.

"My son says he feels like misbehaving and doesn't know why - help pls!
My 10 Yr old started to open up recently and there's a few pretty disturbing behaviours/confessions.

He likes ""intentionally making grandma angry because it's funny when she's pissed."" 

He also likes annoying the adults if he wants to get out of a situation fast eg. grocery shopping. It's pretty rude and reckless behaviour especially when he's out with 78 yr old grandma because his favourite thing to do is to step on his chaperone's feet mid stride as well as hold his bag arms outstretched and twirl in circles. He doesn't sulk when confronted but instead cracks a smile. 

Based on my own observation, he either doesn't see things or 'doesn't see them'. I'm not sure which. So he spends most of the time waiting for people to help him with day to day tasks - finding clothes, reading instructions for his games. He also has trouble focusing on his favourite movies for more than 30 minutes so he's ""bored"" all the time. 

I know their brains aren't fully developed at this age but it's still quite worrying as I was quite the opposite. Hoping parents who have experienced this can share a little about how they dealt with these. Tyvm! 

(I've booked him for an assessment just in case. Not sure if it's the right thing to do either. Will appreciate advice not criticism 🙏)","THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BOOKING AN ASSESSMENT!! people wonder why their children have such bad behavioral issues and never take them to get evaluated. Most of the time, it is neurodivergency and it is misunderstood as just being a bad kid. With the right guidance and accommodations, it makes a huge difference. The fact that you care enough to work on it and problem solve is beautiful. Thank you for being a competent parent in a world full of crappy ones. You can’t make him be a good person.

But empathy can be fostered. Removing all tech is typically a good first step.

And then treating them as they treat others."
"School birthday party invitation etiquette question
Looking for advice on the right way to respond to a birthday party invitation from a family we do not know. My daughter recently started pre-K3  and a fellow Mom invited the entire class to her child’s birthday party via the school’s communication app. Using this method to send party invites is per school policy. We are not able to attend so I am wondering if I should text the Mom to let her know not to include us in the head count? This is our first child so I am not sure of the etiquette for children’s parties. Is the RSVP generally for ‘yes’ replies? I am sure I am overthinking this, but I have read many sad stories of parents expecting people to show and they don’t and I would never want to do that to another parent.",RSVPs are for either a yes or no. Please advise either way! RSVP no.  Simple!

"Feeling defeated
I always felt like my first baby was challenging as an infant. She had hip dysplasia and was in a brace full time for the first 3 months then had to wear one to sleep for 3 months after that. I look back at that time and remember it being tough and emotional. But overall, she was a happy baby. 

Second time around has been so much more challenging. My son has been pretty difficult to settle for his 11 weeks of life. He has only just started having times where the noises he makes is his voice/talking rather than screaming his lungs out, and it really only lasts maybe 5-10 minutes. He’s difficult to get down for a nap, and having a toddler doesn’t really help with that. I’m just really not enjoying this part of our lives and it makes me so sad to admit that. I know it will get better, but it’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when everyday seems to be the same with no change. 
We are heading to the doctors tomorrow because he hasn’t pooed in 4 days, which has made his unsettled times worse. 

Just think I needed to vent and have some other experiences to help me get through this. I don’t want to wish the time away but I really am looking forward to when he’s bigger and hopefully easier to settle and be comforted.","Hey /u/jessicaamegann! It looks like you might be new here.

"Arguing.
Hey all. So, me and my wife were having this discussion.
We have a boy who is a bit challenging to deal with. So he’s a teenager, almost 19. 
He doesn’t mistreat his peers, however he does get into fights in school. 
He fights with us as well. By fighting i mean he’s brutally honest with people, he doesn’t shy away from saying something. The way i see it, he’s strong minded and opinionated. 
He hates studying and school. Like he likes sports and artistic stuff. But math and history don’t get into his head. 
He has also smoked pot and drinks with his peers from time to time. 
I was telling my wife that i don’t like his partying habits, but im not one of those parents who would want their child to be a yes man or be a pushover. 
Esp when he starts dating as he gets older and deals with difficult people and situations, his confrontational attitude is not gonna be so negative. I think people just perceive it that way. So does my wife. She wants him to be what i would describe in a way, timid. She says well behaved. 
I also said that if he doesn’t want to study the usual subjects, he can find something rhat he likes doing and that might pay him well in the future. 
She begs to differ. 
Apart from the partying i support my son. I think his argumentative nature is not inherently bad behaviour as long as he is not bullying someone or something like that. 
My wife compares him to other classmates who are more well behaved and are more reserved. 
I personally think he can be good at design and architecture.

I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place with my 10 yo son and husband. Lately they have not been getting along. I’m not sure if it’s my son going through preteen emotions or what.

If he stubs his toe or something he cries, especially if there is blood. He gets super emotional if his feelings are hurt. I’m just so over it ugh.","You need to pull your husband aside and get him to understand that he's harassing and infantilizating your son. He either needs to apologize and change his behavior or your son will escalate in his reactions until someone gets actually hurt.

"7-year-old daughter won't stop crying about elementary school after first week
My daughter (7) just started elementary school last week, and it's been incredibly difficult. Every morning is a battle of tears, refusals, and meltdowns. Even after school, she's emotional and exhausted.

We've tried talking about her specific fears, established a consistent routine, stayed positive about school, and I've even resorted to bribing her with treats and special snacks. Nothing seems to help the crying episodes.

Her teacher says she eventually calms down after I leave, but starting each day with my child so distressed is breaking my heart.

For parents who've navigated this: Does it get better? How long did your child take to adjust? Any specific strategies that worked for you? I'm starting to think bribing with food isn't the right approach, but I'm desperate for solutions.

I'm looking for both reassurance and practical advice - I'm exhausted and worried this might indicate a bigger issue than just normal transition anxiety.","I feel like at 7 she should be able to articulate what she dislikes,  and maybe some ideas about what might make it better. 

Does she miss you? Does she hate school? Is she tired or hungry? Are the other kids mean? Would she rather be at home watching TV? 

What did she do up until 7? Surely this isn't her first time in an organized setting? is this her first time in school?"
"I lost my cool on my 8 year old. Need help
My daughter just turned 8 yesterday & I’ve been having a lot of issues with her for a while now. She really thinks this is her world & everyone else is just living in it. She does not listen, she talks back, she whines & yells, she has issues in school (talking in class & interrupting). Tonight we did our bedtime routine. I told her to wash up, go to the bathroom, put pj’s on, grab a snack & a water so she can get to sleep. She finishes her snack, goes in the kitchen to grab a juice. I told her no juice, just water because it’s so late & we’ve talked about how juice isn’t a good option before bed because of the sugar. She stomped her feet on the floor, upset because “it’s not fair.” So I sent her to bed, with nothing. I’ve tried so many different things over the years. Making different types of charts (chore charts, reward charts, charts for evening schedules, etc) I’ve taken away toys, grounded her, taken away electronics, offered positive rewards/reinforcements, I’ve read & read on how to do things differently ex: letting her have choices- do you want to do your homework/shower/clean up now or in 10 minutes? & nothing is working. Her dad is not really involved in her life (his choice), but our life is stable. I make decent money, we’ve lived in the same place since she was 2.5, I’ve been with my SO for 3 years. I did recently have a baby in May, but these issues have been going on long before I was pregnant. I’ll admit - I am at fault. She’s extremely spoiled & gets everything she wants all the time. I just wanted her to have what I didn’t have growing up but I fear that I have really messed up. I don’t know what else to do, I’ll take any advice. I have a feeling she is “neurospicy” but the evaluation has determined that she is not.","If all she said is “it’s not fair!” With a stomp, I’d let it go.

Because it does suck sometimes.  Mom seems to be able to eat what she wants when she wants, I don’t!  It’s the definition of unfair!

There is literally nothing in your post that makes me concerned at all, unless there are bigger things you’re leaving out Echo the consistency on the rewards and punishments"
"Take a moment to appreciate your kids
I was at the playground with my son yesterday . Kids were running everywhere, parents looked worn out after the long weekend, most scrolling on their phones. Then one boy came up and started playing with my son, who is non-verbal autistic.This kid talked a mile a minute, full of curiosity and energy. I joined in the conversation, and it turned into such a warm moment.


Sometimes I wish my son could talk to me, tell me what he’s thinking, or share little stories about his day.","As a fellow mom to a non verbal 9yo, I feel you 🫶🏼 it took a long time for me to understand the need to grieve the son I thought I would have, and to be able to appreciate the things we all take for granted Tell me about it.

"Nursery crying

He’s had issues with a little girl there who he says hits him and it seems to be playing on his mind at home too. It has been addressed to teachers who tell me they are trying to seperate them. 



But every morning it’s screaming crying, u get photos to show he’s ok not long after but the drop offs are killing me, how long does this last? 


Not sure if it matters much but I’m now a single mum but was a stay at home mum since he was born really only just returning to education now hence the 3 days at nursery.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Parenting) if you have any questions or concerns.* Maybe at first, just until the crying and tantrums stop, tell your little boy that once he’s done and you pick him up, you’ll do something special together. Go to the park. Go get some ice cream. Get a treat from the gas station. It’s the little things. I used to love when my mom would pick me up as a kid and surprise me with things like this. He’s a little boy, so I guarantee you even just bringing him to a gas station and letting him pick out a treat will be exciting for him. Even if it’s a small one. Going to school or nursery or whatever, for a young child, can be stressful at first because the child has been with you every second of every day up until these moments. 

Tell him “okay, buddy. I know you’re scared for mommy to leave you at nursery but I need you to be a good boy. If you be a good boy, mommy will bring you to get ice cream together after I pick you up”. Positive reinforcement is key here for young minds. Teach him that yes he won’t be seeing you for a little bit, but you’re not leaving him forever and once you pick him up, you will spend great time together and do things together. The kid is anxious for you to leave. If you just keep showing him that you’re coming back for him (obviously, but in his mind it might not be so obvious because he’s a baby) he won’t fight you forever. It’s just new for him."

"Single mom after betrayal, trying to stay strong for my baby
I (31F) was about 9 months postpartum when my fiancé (33M) I’ve been with almost 6 years started cheating. At the time, I couldn’t understand why he had suddenly become so cold and distant. He stopped helping with the baby and basically left me to do everything alone. I thought he was struggling with mental health, but the truth was he had another woman.

When I finally found out, he cried and swore it was over with her. Days later, he asked me to take our baby and go stay at my parents’ so he could “be alone.” Instead, he went back to her. Since then, it’s been nothing but lies, empty promises, and him choosing her over us.

I’m raising our daughter basically on my own, while he comes in and out of her life. He’ll visit, say he misses me, apologize, and talk about wanting to “fix our family” — but then he goes right back to her. I know I shouldn’t even consider going back, but sometimes I’m so lonely and hurt that I’m tempted. I miss the idea of us being a family, even though I know the reality was him abandoning me and our baby.

I guess I’m just struggling. I want my daughter to grow up with stability and love, and I don’t want to model a toxic relationship for her. I know logically we deserve so much better than a man who lies, cheats, and runs from responsibility. But emotionally, it’s hard.
For those of you who have been through something similar — how did you find strength and move forward as a single parent? How do you let go of the fantasy of a perfect family and embrace building a healthier life for your child instead?","Went through this myself. I think I would’ve ended up staying except my ex ultimately left me for the other woman. Now I am so, so grateful he left. Being a single mom was hard. And lonely. And sometimes I still feel sad my daughter didn’t get her mom and dad together. But she told me herself the other day (I mentioned my parents got divorced when I was 5) and she said she was so happy she didn’t know any different than her parents being split basically. She was really sad I was 5 and felt like I lost something. For whatever it’s worth she’s 8 and well adjusted and wonderful. 

It took me years to heal and it was hell. But now I’m in a good place and remarried and it made me strong as hell too. It's hard, I won't lie. But ultimately,  it worked out for the best. My daughter was 5 months old when my ex started the affair. I tried to make it work at first, but realized I would never be able to trust or forgive him. I decided it was better to just end it and move on. I bought a house and made the stability I wanted for my child. She is happy and thriving and I am at peace knowing I made the right decision."

"Am I biased? My kiddo bites in daycare
As the title says, my kid (2 y/o this month) bit another toddler in daycare today. This is the fourth time it's happened. The first time was nearing 2 months ago, and daycare told us right away, sent an incident report, all that. The second time it happened was a couple weeks later. Daycare told us in person during pick up; saying that my child was having a hard time sharing, screamed, hit, fought his nap, and had bit again. The next day at pick up, daycare gave me a letter that said he had bit again and laid out the incidents of that day and the day before, saying we had one month to see improvement or he would be terminated from the program.

I totally understand the provider's worries. My kid was constantly bitten at his last daycare (part of the reason we switched) and it was so hard to know that someone hurt my baby when I couldnt help him. If I were in the daycare's shoes, I would want to be strict with biting too. Knowing that, I took this very seriously. My S/O and I came up with a plan to address behaviors at home better, to make our child share more at home, we got him exposed to more toddlers his age at play dates, and even asked all our extended family to be firm when they noticed he threw a fit or refused to share with them too.

My child made marked improvements in the month that his since passed! As far as I was aware, there had not been any more behaviors or biting at daycare, my S/O and I even made efforts to check in with the provider every day to see if anything had occurred or if we needed to take him home early, always met with ""no, he's having a great day! :)"". I felt confident that we would make it through the month's probation bite free and he would be allowed to stay. 

...until today. I got the message that my child bit for the fourth time and my heart sank:
""This seemed unprovoked and your child was having a great day up until this moment, also all week we haven't had any unusual melt downs or incidents like this. However it does concern me that he wants to bite when angry or doesn't get what he wants especially since  an infant will be joining daycare tomorrow. At some point I have to stop allowing this in my daycare and the next time your child bites another child I will provide a letter of termination.""

Since this is the anonymous internet, I have to admit that I don't agree with the provider on this. Yes, I understand that biting is bad, but after working directly with the provider, working at home, and seeing serious improvements, I feel sort of shocked that this incident is the last straw. I see it as a slip-up of course, but to after nearly 4 weeks with no issues, I expected a little more grace about it. 

I also feel hurt personally. I've made a lot of effort to correct these behaviors, and I genuinely don't think I'm raising a bad kid. For the most part, he's very happy, curious, funny, and even polite. Yes, he has meltdowns when he doesn't get what he wants, but don't all almost-two years olds?? Does this punishment fit the crime of being an emotionally immature toddler? I feel like I've been very neutral and put in a lot of work to try to fix this situation. That's why I need your help: am I being too biased by taking my child's side here? Does an almost 2 year old deserve termination for 4 biting instances over 2 months?","Your kid is not a bad kid and you are not a bad parent, but there is a limit to how many times they can allow this to happen before the provider has to act to protect the other children. Honestly I think it’s pretty fair. Five unprovoked bite incidents is more than my children’s daycare would have allowed. Yes sorry but if your kid bit my kid I would be livid and people pay a lot of money to put their kids in daycare they don’t deserve to be bit by your child"
"Daycare- acceptable or not?
I (single mom) live in small town Oklahoma. It’s not where I’m from, so culturally I’m out of my depth but my community here insist it’s normal so I need some broader input.

Is it acceptable/normal for daycare workers to yell/yank kids? My daughter (2yo) is very calm & listens really well so I don’t yell at her, but I understand that having 8 of them is a different situation. 

All I heard was the teacher yell “no ma’am” super loud and then my daughter started crying and she was cradling her arm. The teacher then said “she’s hateful.” 
When I came around the corner it appeared that the worker had yanked her arm or a toy out of her hands but I’m not sure. 
At first I thought she was just startled but she cried for over a half hour and was hyperventilating still holding her shoulder. I’ve never known her to be dramatic or whiney so it really alarmed me. 

I do hear them yelling a lot at the other kids (even in the baby room) and the other parents seem fine with it so I guess that’s just the way things are here. 

This is the 2nd daycare I’ve tried here, the last one I pulled her out of bc she started shaking her dolls and yelling “shut up go to sleep” & it freaked me out. Everyone here said I was overreacting that time too, but she doesn’t watch tv yet so she had to pick it up from daycare & she had gotten a split lip under dubious circumstances the same week so I couldn’t take the risk. She was in daycare in my home state up until we moved 6 months ago and had no problems at all. 

I’m wondering if maybe yelling is just pretty normal culturally and I’m just over sensitive? They’re not hitting her or anything but idk, it just makes me really uncomfortable & I do think she got hurt even if it was an accident.

Any advice would be welcome, even if it’s a reality check.","Absolutely unacceptable. That's not a good environment for a kid. It may be normal in the backwoods of hell, but you should not accept your daughter being physically and mentally abused. Absolutely not."
"Reading success story
We were going on a 2.5 week trip,  with my daughter who was going to turn 7 (entering second grade) We had got her a kindle so we didn’t have to lug a bunch of books (she was still on graphic novels and picture heavy books), and while we let her use a tablet to watch good tv and movies on plane trips or long drives (not at home), we wanted to minimize its use.
My father gave her a paperback of the first ""Series of Unfortunate Events.""  at the end of the first few days. 

She finished it in a day. Over the rest of the holiday, she devoured the entire series, asking for the kindle while on car journeys or while waiting for meals (a useful distraction at adult dinners) or at bedtime.

She was pleasurably outraged at the perfidy of Count Olaf, engaging adults with interesting points she just had just encountered.

It was unbelievable how quickly the penny dropped on pure text once she started.","My daughter loved those books too!

She has recently reached the age of just grabbing random books from our shelves and reading them. Last week she ready Amy Pohler's autobiography followed by a book about the history of Polio (she's still also reading books more targeted at her)

Once they get in the habit it's great when it's locked in. Though we sometimes have to ask her not to take books everywhere as it can be rude to start reading at for example"
"4 Year Old Suspended
We started week 3 of school today. My son is 4 and he is in TK (Transition Kindergarten) it’s a new Grade Level they added in our district, not sure how common it is other places. 

My son has BIG feelings. Since he came out of the womb, he has had big feelings. He is an incredibly strong willed kid. It’s been extremely hard parenting him. My husband and I try our best, and I do believe we are great parents. But, goodness, it’s hard. He had a few bad days when he first started school, but last week he had four GREAT days in a row. His teacher was very impressed and happy. Well he went back today and it was terrible. I mean really BAD. He was told it was time to switch stations, he didn’t want to. He told his teacher and her aid “no” when they told him he had to, he completely lost control and become “aggressive” (words they used) he slapped the aid in the stomach and told her he was going to “kill her”… I have NEVER heard those words come out of son’s mouth. Never. We do not use words like that in our household and when I found all of this out, I burst into tears. I really don’t know what to do. Punishments don’t seem to work. We have tried spanking in the past, when things got really bad. But my husband and I have both decided we will never use that form of punishment again. Taking things away doesn’t work, talking gently doesn’t work, it seems like NOTHING WORKS. When he feels a big emotion, he FEELS it. It’s like he sees black and all of the progress we have made was all for nothing. 


My son is amazing in SOOOO many ways. He’s funny, so smart, kind, silly, sweet, and his smile could light up an entire room. He greets all his friends with a wave and smile every morning when we get to school. He hugs his teacher when he sees her. He’s EXCITED for school. He likes school. 

This whole situation is breaking me. As a mom, I feel embarrassed that MY son is becoming the “bad” kid in class. I remember the bad kid from school. We all remember who the bad kid was in school. I do not want that to be my son. Because he’s not bad. 😢 I don’t know what else to do besides ask other people for help and advice. I’m embarrassed to even be posting this. I wish I didn’t have to. But I’m reaching a breaking point. I love my son more than anything in this world, but he is making me feel a way towards him that I do not want to feel. How do I make this better? How do I help him?","Your son is not bad.

You are not bad parents!

However, your son does need to learn to control his big feelings.

Until he learns, he shouldn't be in school. It doesn't matter how big your feelings are both physical violence (slapping) and threatening violence (saying you're going to kill someone) are never okay.

It sounds to me like what you've been doing so far hasn't been working. You might need some help.

Have you talked to your pediatrician? Have you considered evaluation for something like ADHD?

Some kids do well with some play-based therapy.

Some kids do well with medication.

And some grow out of it, and all that's needed is patience."
"How to deal with attention seeking children (not mine) at the playground
Hello, I'm an early 30s father of a 2yo. My daughter has lots of energy and loves exploring so we go to the park a lot and play together.

Because she is only 2 I stay with her when she climbs, etc. because she is pretty bold. I trust her, but one slip at her age could be pretty bad. Anyway, when we play together at the park, I help her climb (support but let her do the work of figuring out what to do) and play little games together. Very interactive.

Here's where my question comes in, it's not about her, it's about other kids. What seems to happen semi frequently is slightly older children (4-6) who are semi/fully unsupervised will gravitate towards us and start ""showing off"" or keep trying to engage in attention seeking behavior with *me*. My daughter is very social and loves to say hi to new friends. If she expresses interest in another child around her age we will go over together and introduce ourselves to the parent and child.

My issue is when these children engage with us, without a parent, and specifically seek attention from me, the adult. If they play with my daughter it's fine, but I don't know what to do when they focus on me. I can't really focus on them, because I'm playing with my daughter, but feel bad ignoring them too. I also feel uncomfortable being put in a position of perceived responsibility over their behavior and actions. 

This is mostly a problem of not having their parent come over when they see their kid engaging with another adult, not for stranger danger reasons, just for awkness sake.

Any advice on how to handle these situations?  Am I overreacting? It's nothing wrong with the kid, they love attention, I see it more as a parenting thing, but let me know your thoughts/experience.","I just say something like “wow, cool” I might say to my kid “look at those fun tricks” or whatever and then return to what I was doing. Sometimes I have said something like “sorry I can’t watch right now, I’m helping my kid do xyz” and generally they move along.  If they ask for help doing something, I direct them to their parent. 

I would say 5/6 year olds shouldn’t need a parent hovering over them at the playground like younger ones do. I do intervene if it seems like my kid is bothering someone else, but in my experience these are pretty normal interactions and I’ve never had an issue handling it the way I described above. I have three kids and littles are always coming up to talk to me and show off, I assume because I'm already giving attention to multiple and they just slip in. I smile, I nod, I glance so they aren't ignored (sometimes I say a generic, ""oh yeah?"" or ""oh wow?""), but I don't turn my full attention away from my kids and if my kids want me to play or follow them, I go. Sometimes I say ""see ya"" or ""bye bye"" to the chatter, but I usually just do a little smile and take off."
"Birthday ideas for 5 year old?
My son is turning 5 soon, he's been asking to have a party or gathering or something. What are some creative ideas for birthday celebrations?

He has 3 friends that we'd be inviting, along with their parents and siblings.

Thank you so much for any help!","What about renting a park shelter with a play ground? When my daughter turned 5 we did a pancake and pajama party. We invited guests to wear their pajamas and bring their favorite stuffed animal if they wanted. It was a pajama party with brunch at our home. (I think our start time was 10am) We made home made pancakes, bacon, fresh fruit. I had my mom (Grandparent) read a story to the kids & we played games. Everyone loved it!"
"One kid gets a trust - what would you do?
My grandpa has in his will that all grandkids and great grandkids will get $xx,xxx. My grandpa's health is declining, and I currently have one kid. We plan to have one or two more, but neither would likely be born before my grandpa passes away. The will stipulates that the money for my son will go into a trust that he'll have access to when he turns 18. This means the money must go to him and cannot be split between anybody else (including future siblings). 

My dilemma is that this puts my firstborn at a large advantage over his siblings purely because he was born at the right time. He's 16 months and hasn't met his greatgrandpa many times. The initial amount isn't life-changing, but it will be invested for likely 16+ years. 

We currently contribute a small amount monthly to an investment account for my son. We plan to contribute the same amount to each kid we have. At this point, we cannot afford to match my grandpa's contributions though. 

The only option that comes to mind is to put my inheritance into an account for our future kid/kids. If we have one more kid, easy. If we have two, we'd probably have to split the money into two accounts and then contribute additional money to their accounts while pausing or reducing the amount we contribute to my oldest.

I understand life isn't fair and nothing will be 100% even, but I cannot get onboard with the idea that one kid will have a big advantage just because of their birth timing. 

What would you do?","You can start saving now for future kids, and simply not put additional money to oldest kid until everyone is even. 

Example: 2 year old gets $10,000 from gpa, to be invested the next 16 years.
Set aside $20k as soon as you can for potentially 2 more kids. Once kid #2 turns 2, pop $10k into investments for 16 years, repeat for kid 3. If no kid 3, then enjoy your $10k or split between the 2 kids (more for older because he will have less time of it being invested). 

It’ll be tough I am sure to save up to match gpa, but you aren’t pregnant yet with kid #2 or #3, and to be “even” you don’t need to have that money until the next kid is 2 years old (or however old kid #1 is when he gets inheritance). Just don’t set aside extra for kid 1 until you can match it for kid 2, and possibly 3. Then do the best you can to evenly distribute the rest of the way. Sounds like you already know what to do. Your best bet will be to take the same amount (either saved or removed fr your inheritance) to each future child's account for the same amount of time."
"Monthly photo book subscription alternatives to Chatbook?
I LOVE the model of Chatbook. But their app has been so buggy and they keep making frustrating changes. I used to be able to order a photobook for my daughter (so she has physical photos when she is bigger) and then easily send a copy of the same books to my inlaws who live out of state. 
Now the default and only option is to order a duplicate copy and send it to yourself, which is dumb. I don't need two copy and don't have enough executive functioning or time left over to then forward it out of state. I contacted customer service and did some research online and the current solution is contact customer service everytime you want to send to another address. But I need this to be easy so it actually happens. 

All this to say, are there similar services? I looked at MPix and Mixbooks and it's not exactly the same. I like the monthly subscription model because it holds me accountable.",FamilyAlbum I still use Snapfish...The projects get saved so you could reorder them as needed
"Sleep solution :)
A few days ago I came on here venting about my sons tantrums during bedtime. It had been a rocky few days & has truly made me feel like I’m the worst parent ever…. Well I found a solution the other night & tested it out tonight aswell to see if it would work  & I’m happy to say it did 😏 my son does not understand the concept of “ it’s time to wind down & go to bed” without going ape shit crazy. Well after him going insane the other night I decided I was done fighting him & told my husband to leave him alone as well i end up shutting the whole house down no lights on anywhere only a bit of light coming through the blinds. At first he didn’t like it for a couple minutes,then he ran into the room with my husband & went & laid down with him after 10 minutes or so without having another breakdown. So tonight after he took his bath & got lotioned up I did the same thing and turned everything off in the house & went to lay in his bed I told him it was sleepy time saying things like “I’m so sleepy” “goodnight” “i love you” “let’s lay down” & i can’t believe it but he didn’t cry not one bit he came to lay next to me after walking around in the dark for a few minutes & he eventually fell asleep took him about 30 minutes no crying no screaming no scratching or biting!!!!! I feel like super mom right now & im hopeful I will be able to keep this going throughout the rest of my pregnancy & not have anymore emotional rollercoasters 🤠 just sharing something I found out to help because these past few weeks have been hectic so if your toddler is anything like mines I suggest you try “shutting the whole house down” definitely if they know how to open doors I think that is helping him understand it’s time to call it day . I’ll post an update in a few weeks & see how things hold up I plan to do this every night now !!!! 😎😎 I hate losing my cool with him & it makes me feel guilty everytime so I’m just happy that I’m finding something that’s helping both of us 🥹🥹","That’s a solid win. Kids usually respond better to environment cues than words at that age. Dark house = sleep time makes total sense. Stick with it and it’ll probably get easier each night. Hey /u/Aapeso4444!

"My daughter’s tantrums have put me at my breaking point.
Hello there, this is my first time posting here and i am just at a loss of how to handle these tantrums. 

A little background, my daughters dad and i split when she was a baby and she spends 75% of her time with me and 25% with her dad. She is used to this as it’s really all she’s known. Her dad and i both have life partners; so she has a step dad, my partner, and a step mom, her dad’s partner. 

My (30f) daughter (10f) has a really tough time controlling her tone and emotions. It’s something we have been working on for a little while. She has started like pre puberty so i know emotions are on the rise and understand this comes with the territory of a tween. She is an absolute angel at school. Top student, has lots of friends, and is really a kind girl. Her teachers have always been so impressed with how focused and on task she is. I don’t know what changes once she gets home. Sometimes she’s wonderful at home, however, i would say at least once a day, she throws these wild tantrums. Like sprawled out, on the floor calling mom over and over again when I’m literally standing right next to her asking what’s going on. I keep my calm for longer than most, but it gets to a point where i start to lose my patience. Before we get to that point I do my best to help her work through whatever the issue is. Try to give her solutions. Tell her I’m so sorry she’s feeling whatever emotion it may be, I’m very empathetic. Nothing seems to console her and it feels like she just wants attention. This is hard for me to comprehend because her and my son both have my attention all day after school and on the weekends I have her. I take them to do fun things, we do play dates, go to the skate park, we are very active as a family. My partner is also very involved in this, he works at the kids school so he sees how wonderfully behaved she is there too. I just don’t understand where this is coming from. I don’t know how to help her navigate these tantrums. I’m tired and I feel like I’m failing. 

When does it get easier? Is this normal behavior for her age? How can i help her get better control over her emotions?","This is not normal. You should speak to a professional at this point. Lacking emotional control at that age is normal but tantrums daily are not. No this is definitely not typical and you should  have her evaluated.

It's said that neurodivergence in girls can end up diagnosed later because they ""mask"" more effectively and/or maybe the behaviours are less apparent than with boys for some of them. So perhaps she's collapsing at the end of the day because she's having a meltdown or ""restraint collapse"" from finally being at home and not having to pretend to be ""normal""."
"How did you handle the newborn growth spurts?
I think my daughter is starting to experience a growth spurt. She is 5 weeks old today. Although she still sleeps a bunch, I’ve noticed during her wake windows she is very easily overstimulated. She was awake for about two hours this evening, and getting her to sleep she was clearly over tired. 

What did you do with your babies that offers stimulation, but doesn’t get them to the point of overstimulating. I normally hold and talk to her.. I’m moving this week so it’s been incredibly difficult and I feel bad that I haven’t been able to bond with her the way I usually can.","You're overthinking this. She's going to experience many, many ""upgrades"" in the coming weeks and months; sometimes she will be fussy and you won't be able to stop or control it. There is a limit to the degree you can optimize interacting with an infant. You will just stress yourself out trying to do the perfect thing for each micro-stage of her development. /u/Aromatic-Insect1999, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"Small apartment and two small kids...tips needed.
We have a relatively smaller living situation. My husband, two kids, and I live in a two bed/one bath apartment. It's about 900 square feet. Eventually my kids will need to share their room. For now my three year old son is in a toddler bed solo in his room at night while my three month old daughter is in a pack n play in our room. 

My son is LOUD. His little feet pitter patter on our hardwoods, he yells at a base level volume, and is chaos in person form. I love him tons. He's so great with his sister, but man is it difficult to get a peaceful, quiet environment for her to sleep. Evenings are now the most challenging time since my daughter has started daycare this week and will be attending the same daycare as my son during the week. Trying to figure out how to balance bedtimes and both of their needs has been a huge juggle and I constantly feel like my daughter is overtired and not getting to sleep soon enough because it's a huge scramble every night.

The distance between the bedrooms and the bathroom is like 4 feet total...it's tight. So any noise from any of those rooms is heard in the other adjacent spaces. We do use white noise machines and tell our son to use soft voices, not to run, and to play quietly every night but his ability to remember that is limited.

We're tired. It's a lot to manage. And we don't have the ability to move somewhere bigger until we stop paying for daycare for my son in two years. We live in a HCOL area and pay $4770 a month for both daycares per month...it's insane. So we have to make this work for the time being.

I need tips from others who have managed small space living with two young ones. Please help!","/u/mityasmom, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"My son's first day of pre k and I'm a nervous wreck
So as the title says above it's my 4 year old son's first day of pre k tomorrow and I'm just nervous as heck. I'm sure that every parent goes through this . One of my concerns is the schedule change, I've been trying to get him into bed earlier and up earlier, I haven't been super successful and I did start a little late. He has to be up at 630 am hes normally up around 8-9 am Reason being was I wasn't even sure that he was going this year because we had moved from a bigger city area to smaller town and I wasn't sure if they had a pre k but anyways . 
My second worry/ concern whatever you may call it is that apparently this goes all day, I'm in NY and last I knew they only went half a day so that's a little bit of a shock. I'm nervous he's gonna be like I just wanna leave and he's going to hate it 😭 we had our open house tonight and he was just super overwhelmed. 
And my last main worry is the bus . He.forsnt get his own separate bus as far as I'm understanding and it goes up to 4th grade. I'm all for doing transportation in the morning , I just wouldn't be able to get him from school on Mondays and Fridays. They have an after school program but that's already a long day so idk about that. 
Anyways if you've read up to here I appreciate it . Mainly just looking for feedback, thoughts, experiences. Thank you!","Don't worry, it's not the same when having grownups in the house and when he's there with other kids playing, he'll definitely cry at first but he'll get used to it eventually.

"Rethinking my choice of a dual-language kindergarten after day one
Today was my son’s first day of kindergarten. It was an orientation day with kids and their parents. I signed him up for a dual-language immersion program where half the kids are supposed to be native English speakers learning Spanish, and half native Spanish speakers learning English. They switch languages daily and don’t repeat lessons.

I chose this program because my son is very advanced in English and math (he’s already reading at a first-grade level), and I thought learning Spanish would challenge him in the right way. I also personally value Spanish — I speak fluently and I think Spanish in the U.S. is incredibly important.

Here’s my concern: in his class of 25, almost all the kids are Latino and Spanish-speaking. It’s basically him and one other white kid. Instead of the “half and half” balance the program is supposed to have, he’s the minority racially and linguistically.

Another factor I didn’t realize until orientation: the kids in this program stay together all the way through elementary school (up until 7th grade or beyond). Aside from lunch, they aren’t integrated with the other 50–70% of students in the school. So this feels like more than just a classroom placement: it’s essentially a 7-year decision about his peer group and social environment.

Now I don’t know what to do. Do I leave him where he is, or move him to a regular English class? There are 2–3 additional dual-language classes in the school, but I don’t know if the demographics are the same there.

I want to bring this up with the principal, but I don’t even know how to start that conversation. Has anyone else gone through something like this?","I’m sorry op but, do you know that these other kids are Spanish speakers as their primary language? And that they don’t speak English? Because a lot of Hispanic families don’t teach their children Spanish at home because they’re afraid they’ll be stereotyped as non-English speaking Latinos (which you’ve just done so). If that’s not the case I apologize.

My own child would be considered a primarily English speaker, even though she understands Spanish and her father speaks it to her. It’s still not her primary language. And she would benefit from a dual immersion program because she’d learn how to write and read in Spanish, something a lot of bilingual kids aren’t taught. 

Giving this program more than a day won’t hurt, but if you have concerns you can ask to speak with the teacher. if him being fluent in spanish is important to you and you don’t speak it at home, seems like a heavier concentration of spanish-speaking kids would be beneficial to the goal."
"Trouble with friends in high school
My daughter (17, Junior, we can call her ""A"") struggles with girls in her grade. Its hard to put down into words what I'm trying to get out so be patient with me if I ramble. She goes to a really small school. She maybe has 62 kids in her grade currently. She has built many friendships but they all seem to fizzle out. There is one girl she was best friends with (we will call her E).. they've since stopped being friends and its causing issues. ""E"" is the kind of girl that thinks you cant be friends with people she doesn't like and if you are then you're against her. If she's talking badly about someone and you don't agree or join in the drama, you're the enemy. Which is why we are where we are. My daughter doesnt like to be like that and she would tell ""E"" she wanted a drama free year and to just get through school without any issues.  I'm not here to say my daughter is a perfect angel, she's not. She doesn't pretend that everything is everyone else's fault. She owns up to her crap. ""E""is trying to turn everyone against her and it seems to be working. Girls my daughter has been friends with, that werent friends with ""E"" are now friends with her and icing my daughter out. She says it's ""whatever"" and she isnt getting sucked into that kind of drama but I know it hurts her feelings that the kids she would hang out with or spend the night with are now turning against her just because one girl all of a sudden is mad at her. I've told her to just be her normal self, keep conversing normally with everyone and maybe the weirdness will fizzle out once ""E"" has accomplished what she wants and doesnt have anything to do with them anymore, which is exactly what will happen. I feel awful for her. Sometimes it really sucks living in such a small community. Is this a normal high school experience these days?

"Clashing with your co-parent
How do you handle disagreeing with your co-parent? Is it good, in your experience, to disagree in front of the child? I often disagree with tone or approach with my child’s father. I want to say something right away but wonder if it’s appropriate. It could feel like bickering or discord to the child but keeping quiet until later also feels wrong.","My wife is the kind of person to speak her mind immediately, she doesn't have any kind of filter. 


We each have our own ways but unless I think she's being too harsh, which is rare, I won't try to correct her. When I think she us being roo harsh, I say something right there. It's usually met with ""You're not the one she just hit"" and she says no more. Hey /u/liz-the-wizz! It looks like you might be new here.

"First day jitters/bullying
My daughter comes home from elementary today, on the bus and walking home alone for the first time (all big!! things)

When she approaches me she’s visibly upset, there was a mixup on the bus about where she was to be dropped off which can be scary the first time you’re on the bus- 
enter 2 kindergartners?! Boy and a girl start teasing her bc she’s upset, stealing her stuff and blocking her way. 

Excuse me? 

This is day 1 kindergarten behavior??!! Nope. 
Not going to have it. 

Do I approach the parents directly or the school to address the kindergarteners on KNOW YOUR PLACE?","Direct it to the school.

"Keeping home from kinder for bad night sleep?
My daughter is NOT tired tonight, it's almost 1 am and she's still wide awake. I just brought her into my bed, but i told my husband ""we may need to keep her home tomorrow"" and he thinks im insane lol. I just feel bad! I do see how it sounds a bit nuts, but I'm a sahm and it's possible. Also, i would hate teachers thinking I'm a shit parent if she looks overtired, plus I don't want her feeling like shit either! What do you guys do if your kid gets no sleep on school nights?","I’m a school nurse and former sahm who definitiely understands the concern about lack of good sleep. I’d suggest you send her to school and just shoot the teacher an email letting her know it was a rough night. Kinder teachers get it. Most will appreciate the heads up but would definitely prefer you send your kid to school even if tired. I would send her.  You don’t want to get in the pattern of rewarding staying up all night by getting to stay home and rest/Watch tv all day/chill with mom instead of going to school. 

She may have a rough day and be exhausted. That is a good natural consequence of staying up way too late."

"December birthday?
I had a random curious thought while I was awake last night tending to my teething daughter. What do parents do when their child’s birthday falls a week before Christmas? I feel guilty thinking about having a birthday during the busiest and costliest time of the year but on the other hand, I would love to celebrate my child. Any thoughts?","It should be treated like any other birthday. Dec 21st bday here. 😇 I’d say the most important things that I remember my own parents doing is separating gifts and having birthday paper for my bday gifts. 

My mom always decorated specifically for my bday too, and we’d do a birthday only activity. We had parties in the summer as a “half birthday” when we were older a few times but other than that it was a regular birthday. 35 now and no complaints."
"How do I get my Little one to eat at Daycare
Hey all!

We are in Ontario Canada btw

So I’m in a bit of a pickle here. My son just turned 22 months and he’s been starting daycare for the past 2-3 weeks. Our daycare is great that they feed the kiddos breakfast lunch and dinner. But our little one is being very picky about food the past couple months so it is making life difficult for him at daycare.

We skip breakfast and feed him at home. Drop him off at around 9:15 at daycare and have to pick him back up at 11:45am because he doesn’t eat lunch there. They’ve let him roam around during food time, gave him both options and don’t force him but he won’t eat no matter what.

They said he must eat something or they won’t allow him to go into naptime and stay full time at daycare.

We’re at our wits end as we feed him same time as the daycare and similar foods but he just won’t eat there.

Anyone have any suggestions or tips to help him eat there?

Even his food from home he doesn’t eat there :(","i wouldn’t worry about it. kids that age are notorious for surviving on air and our frustration. if he’s getting offered 2 other meals and appropriate snacks and isn’t losing weight, he’s almost assuredly getting plenty of calories. Will they let you or your wife sit and eat with him at lunch? My daughter refused to eat lunch the first week or so of daycare at 15 months old. I would come right after nap at snack time and sit with her in my lap while she ate the lunch she refused earlier. I think it helped to get her used to eating in the new setting and she was motivated to eat after skipping lunch. BTW we pack lunch so this was also like only her favorite foods for the first 2 weeks, including treats like yogurt melts to really encourage her.


That's wild that they won't let him nap without lunch, sometimes toddlers simply aren't that hungry! Maybe you can ask if they can attempt the nap of your wife agrees to come right after nap time?"
"What do you do with your kids on the weekends?
My kids are 4.5 & 6. They are both in school (TK & 1st grade). Right now, they are in swim once a week but later this fall they will be in swim + dance/flag football. They get out of school during the week at 2:30 and on Fridays at 12:15. During the week we play at home in the afternoon but on Fridays and we usually go to a park or to the YMCA to swim after school. On Saturday's we go to the YMCA in the morning for 1.5-2 hours. But other than that we have a lot of free time that I try to fill. I don't want them rotting on iPads for hours and hours but I'm running out of ideas. 

My husband and I work full-time opposite schedules so the weekends it's just me taking them places. Because of our opposite schedules, I haven't really committed to more sports for each because I don't have a way to get them both to different places. We have zoo pass to the Zoo and we usually do that once a month. We alternate months of going to Sky Zone. We go to the movies 1-2 times a month. We go for a walk near the beach to ride scooters or go play at the beach/parks but really they only last 11 minutes to 1 hour max before they are over whatever it is we're doing or they can't agree on what they want to do. They have tons of toys, a backyard with a trampoline, a splash pad and bikes. By my childhood standards, they are living the dream but they are ""bored"". 

What else is there to do with them?","Let them be bored! Honestly, I feel like you are already doing so much with them. It may even be that they don’t know how to be bored and find ways to entertain themselves because they are used to you constantly curating activities for them. I say all that but realize it’s easier said than done! you’re doing plenty. 

some weekends we’re gone basically the whole weekend. some weekends they go to the playground for a bit on saturday morning and we go to mass on sunday morning, and that’s it. 

when they say they’re bored, offer some chores or something they don’t want to do. i will also tell my 4.5yo point blank that it is not my job to keep her entertained all the time, and her options are to go find something to do or to go whine and complain in her room about it, but if she follows me around whining at me, i will choose the latter for her lol."
"Looking for help to get off screen.
Hi everyone,
My daughter is 20 months old, and eating has always been a challenge. She was never very interested in solids, and by 15 months she began pushing us away when we tried to feed her. If we placed food on her tray, she would usually just play with it, then eventually get frustrated and cry.

To get her to eat, we started showing her Miss Rachel videos. While she was distracted, we could feed her. This worked, but we don’t like relying on screen time for meals and want to move away from it. Right now, we’re trying two approaches:
	•	sitting with her and encouraging her to eat, or
	•	leaving her to finish on her own.

The problem is, she still refuses to eat much at home. My wife is very anxious that she might be losing weight, and sometimes wants to go back to using videos during meals.

Has anyone else gone through this? How did you help your toddler eat without screens? Any tips from your experience would be greatly appreciated.

Notes:
	1.	This is our first child.
	2.	She has not lost weight, but her weight has been the same for about 3 months.
	3.	She’s teething right now.
	4.	She eats well at daycare, but not at home.","playing with food at this age is normal. not sure why yall are still feeding her but i’d stop that. put her food on her plate, give her utensils, and sit down and eat with her. 

your job is to offer her food. her job is to eat it. Just stop the screens and stop feeding her.

She needs to listen to her own body's cues, and you guys have been overriding that. Your wife is going to need to manage her anxiety in order to fix it. She'll just have to wait it out."
"Anyone else think 3-day weekends are tough with younger kids?
I have a 6 and 8 year old (L1 autism/adhd) and 3-day weekends feel tough. I love family time but by Monday, I’m like, ready for the weekend to be over. Anyone else feel like this? My kids are super active and they want us to play with them all the time. 

Edit: Glad to see I’m not alone. Right now we just got back from the park and my daughter (6) is whining/complaining she’s bored and wants me to play with her after playing baseball/frisbee with them for the last few hours. People ask why don’t they play with one another and all I can say is having one neurodivergent kid kind of changes the game a little. I would love for them to play with one another but they fight more often than not which is more chaos. Basically we are “on” all weekend. 

Edit 2: For those that have a 2/3 year old and say they love it. It’s totally different 2/3 versus 5-8. The 2 year old naps at least once which is a nice little break. Losing nap time was a game changer in terms of navigating weekends.","Anything out of routine is hard. But I do love long weekends and school breaks with them. Do they play together at all? Everyone seems to love that 2 year age gap… By 6 and 8, they can find something to do themselves.  I might plant one family outing in the middle of the day (ice cream or a movie?) but other than that, I am not the entertainment committee."
"I don’t know what to do anymore I feel hopeless
This may seem dramatic I have far from a bad kid, since I don’t think kids are bad necessarily. I have two children. My eldest is 4, she’s in Pre K she’s a lot to deal with I’m not going to lie. She constantly and I mean constantly throws herself on the ground and screams when something goes wrong. It’s no way of getting her up. I have negotiated with her I have gentle parented. I have been stern and said come on let’s go. At school her teacher gives her red faces for those fits. So it’s not just me that’s like come on… mostly cause it’s embarrassing.. she does it at the gym, and the workers look at me like she must have a horrible time at home to be screaming like this. It’s honestly so embarrassing because I am a calm person and quiet. Very reserved. Like come on. I completely lost my shit today and didn’t even talk just grabbed her by her arm and exited. But of course the looks still carrying with me. It’s truly the most dramatic thing ever. I hate attention. She loves it. What are we even going to do? I feel like I’m turning into a mean mom cause I have to always be stern with her as she’s constantly getting in trouble even at school and says “cause I want to cause trouble” she hadn’t had consequences before at home that stuck or made her want to have better behavior until school started a couple weeks ago but now I try and it feels like it’s constant threats. I don’t want to threaten. I don’t want to raise children with fear. I don’t want to feel like a bad mom for saying “no” or the fear of turning into my parent hovering over me. God lord Jesus someone please just help a mom out with some words of wisdom. What can one even do when they don’t give a damn about consequences. I don’t like getting stern it breaks my heart I’m tired of threats, I don’t want to raise fear based children. I wanna raise my children with love and compassion and confidence and it’s hard to do when they test boundaries on purpose. (She has A D H D ) (I try all the right steps to get her up doesn’t work)","what kind of consequences are you trying for the fits at home?

i have a 4yo who has also been really tough, though it seems like maybe we’ve finally had a breakthrough here lately at 4.5 (fingers crossed it continues). she hasn’t been diagnosed yet because apparently no one around here likes to diagnosis early, but her pediatrician and teacher have both brought up ADHD.

anyway… some things we started doing at home about a month ago that finally made a difference:  
•visual aids. we have them in the dining room, her bathroom, and her bedroom to help remind her what she needs to do at different points of the day. it has also helped me tremendously because i say “look at your sign” instead of feeling like i have to walk her through every step of every single menial task she’s done for years.  
•stop threatening. she’s 4. if it’s something she knows she’s not supposed to do or knows she should do, straight to the consequence. saves your own energy and deprives her of attention.  
•and most importantly, when she did what she was supposed to do without a fight, constant whining, or needing to be nagged, we HEAPED on the praise. i mean, went on and on about how big she is getting, how responsible, how helpful, how proud we are, etc., which makes her beam.  

is there a reason you can’t pick her up? don’t get me wrong, my daughter is like 43” and 42lbs now and it’s not easy, especially when she’s in that mood, but i will still surfboard her to her room or to the car if i must. and i think if she gets the impression that, if she throws herself on the floor, there’s nothing you can do about it, that’s only going to reinforce the behavior. Typical parenting does not work on kids who are neurodiverse. Strongly recommend listening to dr Barkley on you tube"
"I don’t want to go to work tomorrow..
I’m 28 and my son is 16 months and I love spending time with him and it’s making me hate work. I’ve had the best Labor Day weekend hanging out at home and doing stuff with him. Today we had a slow morning made breakfast, took a nap, went on a hike, went to the park, and the splash pad and then came home cooked dinner and finished with a bubble bath and I loved it. I am struggling at work I get so homesick I have a pit in my stomach until I get home. I have been really struggling with trying to do stuff after work without getting so anxious because I’m not with my son. I cancel plans with friends every single time because all I can think is I’ve already been away from him working this long why would I want to do anything else but go straight home. It’s making me so sad and I just want to know if this phase will pass or not. I used to love going to work but now I’m dreading it every day. I have an amazing daycare situation where my mom watches him and she also loves it, and sadly I have student loans that I have to pay off before I could even consider not working so any advice on getting through this would be appreciated or has anyone else felt this way??","I don’t have any insight or advice, but wanted to say you aren’t alone. I feel the exact same way after a wonderful Labor Day weekend with my 12 month old, I’m dreading going back to work and being apart even though he has a great daycare situation as well. And I feel the same as you do about after work plans I rarely ever make them and when I do, I feel a pit in my stomach and can’t wait to get home/feel sad I’m missing out on time with him. It’s tough. I’m sorry! ❤️"
"Would I be a terrible mom to miss my child’s third birthday?
I might have a job opportunity that would require me missing my child’s third birthday. We really need the money but it breaks my heart to think I’d be away from him for the whole day and the next. Would it make me awful if I missed it? Obviously we’d find time to celebrate another day but it makes me sick to my stomach that I wouldn’t be with him.","Celebrate another day, like it's the real thing. A 3 year old won't know the difference and it's no different than spending the actual day celebrating! If you need the money, you need the money. Plan something special for another day, and make the morning/evening special. Going to daycare on their birthday will probably be a chance to celebrate with friends, anyways."
"Feeling like a failure
Hello, I’m a single parent to a 14 year old daughter (father been absent since birth, no financial/practical support from him). Things have been extremely difficult financially for the last couple of years and long story short I’m now facing eviction (I got behind on the rent, a payment plan was arranged for the arrears and I missed three repayment instalments for the arrears.) I posted on Reddit for some advice and I’m absolutely devastated at some of the comments I got. I already suffer a lot from mum guilt because since my daughter was born I’ve had to juggle bringing her up alone with working and money has always been tight so she’s missed out on a lot of things people often take for granted. But she’s loved and well looked after and I know it’s a cliche but she’s my absolute world. Her needs have always been my first priority. 

After posting for some advice about the possible eviction, I’ve been getting lots of comments and DMs about how I’m a bad parent and I don’t know how to process this. People have accused me of neglecting my daughter because I’m a working mum, they’ve said she’d be better off with people who can provide for her properly. Someone even said people like me are the reason why people should have to apply to be parents. A few people have said I could lose my daughter if we’re made homeless and someone messaged me to say this will be a good thing for her because she’ll have a fresh start at life. I’m absolutely heartbroken by it. I know I messed up with the rent but it’s been so hard juggling all the bills with the price of everything going up. I’ve paid back 2/3rds of my rent arrears and the missed arrears instalments were because of  needing gas, electricity, food - not for any frivolous spending. 

I’m following up on some advice I was given about contacting Shelter, but I feel like everything is hopeless now and I’ve failed my daughter whatever happens. I don’t even know why I’m posting, I think I just need some emotional support but I also think I don’t deserve it now. I just feel like a failure.","I hope you reported those comments and messages. That's just not right. People are cruel What I’ve learned is if you let strangers on reddit give you their opinion, they are more than likely to trash you. Even when they don’t know the half of it. 
 I don’t have any advice for your rent situation, but I hope everything works out for you and your daughter. I Wish life was easier"
"Spelling help
Looking for a little insight and help regarding my 4th grade son’s spelling mistakes. The school year has started and my son is in an accelerated math class. He is very bright, great reader and good in math, however he still struggles greatly with spelling. He will spell words like school as sckool when the proper spelling in written in the question about. He also misspells words like place, take, and use! I’ve tried telling him to look for hints on the correct spelling but he rushes through. He always says “the teacher doesn’t care” but I know that is not true. 

I’ve noticed that they are tested several times a year on a computer which allows multiple choice so proper spelling isn’t required. They just click the right answer. It doesn’t seem like proper spelling is being taught actively. I think in 2nd grade he had “spelling words” that he was tested on but now it’s “vocabulary words”.

"How do I talk to my 13 y/o son about this...
My son is 13 and he's a great kid. He's never been in any serious trouble and he has shown that he will come to my husband and I if something happens that he knows isn't okay, or if he has questions about something, no matter how awkward. His internet use is monitored, and we have had many many conversations about internet safety. He hangs out with friends who have less restrictions and who knows what they're consuming. 

Cody (not his real name) is at the age of ""peer pressure"" and he's the target demographic for ultra conservative media. This is my main concern. My husband and I are both pretty liberal and have tattoos and grew up being generally ""alternative"". Naturally, our son doesn't want to be like his parents, so his way of rebellion is to conform. Which is fine with us! We encourage him to be true to himself and that it's okay to have different views than us.

I want to have a conversation with Cody about how damaging these algorithms are that are targeting boys his age. We already dealt with Andrew Tate a couple of years ago. Cody learned what human trafficking is and agreed that Tate sucks. But now there's SO much going around and targeting kids about having these ultra conservative values that are rooted in misogyny and racism. My worry is that Cody will retort with ""just because you don't agree with it, doesn't mean it's wrong"" or something along those lines. 

I'm looking for advice about how to present this concern as more of a difference between right and wrong as opposed to a difference of opinion. TIA!","The Social Dilemma is a great documentary about  social media and algorithms etc., we showed it to our teenager and I’m confident it planted some good seeds.

"I can't help but feel resentment to my son...
Hi, I'm a young mom (f17) and have a lot of mental health issues (AuDHD, anxiety disorders, severe depression, and what looks like to my therapist BPD) and I just can't help but feel like I have a parasite attached to me. My son is 16 months (a year and four months) and I adore him, but I wish he was my sibling instead of my son. Every time I look at him all I can feel is that my life has completely fallen apart, my body has been ruined, I failed my education (I dropped out of public school when I was 70% done with my 10th grade year), I've failed my family, and the terrible things his biological father made me go through (assaulted me, beat me, tried to crave his name into me, then tried to pressure me into getting an abortion [your body your choice but it's not available in my state] then wasn't there for the birth, and only saw my son twice in the 7 months he was alive outside of my womb). I know it's not his fault, it's mine, I didn't know plan b didn't work while I was ovulating and I didn't notice till after that my BD had poked holes in the condoms. I'm so exhausted having to wake up everyday and take care of another human being when I can barely take care of myself, let alone a child who is developing and taking constant note of my habits and coping skills. I have a wonderful support system (a great mother and father, as well as a set of grandparents who are happy to help) but they have their own issues and stuff to deal with seeing as I have two little siblings (m4 & f2). I don't know if I should talk to my obgyn about feeling like this because I don't want my son to get taken away from me, but I need help, and I'm unsure if this can still be counted as postpartum or not.

"How do I help my 8.5 year old feel more secure?
My daughter is having a difficult time doing (what I believe to be) age appropriate activities on her own. She has been doing gymnastics 1 hour a week for a year now, and she begged to do cheer at the same place, so we signed her up. I have stayed and watched all of her gymnastics and cheer practices so far. The whole practice she constantly checks for me like she thinks I’m going to disappear or something. I have never once left anywhere she was without telling her before we even get there. I’ve left early a few times for work, but my husband is always there before I leave, and she is aware before we get to practice, and I say bye when I go.

Cheer has turned from 1 hour a week, to 4 hours. 2 hours, twice a week. Today I mentioned I might sit in the car with our dog (he had been crated for most of the day today due to my appointments running late, and I didn’t want to put him back in because I felt guilty). I told her I would go back and forth between inside checking on her and out in the car with our dog, and she had a complete meltdown. She said to just cancel cheer then. 

Another example is now she is old enough for the school bus to let her off without me waiting outside. The bus drops her off at the end of our driveway. We don’t have a long driveway, you can see the whole house and yard from the road. She got very anxious and cried when I said there would be times I won’t be waiting at the end of the driveway.

She is an only child, maybe this has something to do with it? She has no problems leaving us to go to school or a birthday party. 

Any tips or tricks? We want to support her and make sure she knows we love her and will always be there for her, but we also don’t want her being too scared to do things on her own as she gets older.","If you have a school counselor have her drop by. One of mine went through this in first grade. It got bad enough that he was invited to a playdate (with his best friend!) and my husband had to sit outside in the car so he could look out and see that he was there. We talked to the counselor and she invited him to lunch and helped him with some self talk and other techniques to feel safe. It was great for him and he really was able to work through it with us and the counselor very successfully. Hey /u/Pearl2myJam! It looks like you might be new here.

"Is my child broken or something?
5yo girl, only child until now (I'm currently 33 weeks pregnant with twins)

So kindergarten started today and it was, I kid you not, a catastrophe. It was 45 minutes with both her dad and I plus the teacher and 3 other kids. She refused to do anything, told us she was scared and nothing we could say or do would help. Then after that she started running all around the room and hiding. So overall, bad first impression.

Then she came back home, oh lord. It was meltdown over meltdown over the tiniest things and she ended up in time out most of the day. At its peak she was screaming at me with all she had. She ended up going to sleep at 7pm completely exhausted.

I know it's a lot of changes, I know she needs time but seriously, it not viable, we're gonna explode. And with her baby sisters coming I'm terrified it's gonna get worse.","A few folks have blasted you for the timeouts.  I won’t.  I wasn’t there; they weren’t there.  Timeouts can be a good reset.  And some things/rules are important to stick to and not compromise.  Exceptions can be made too of course…

Your child isn’t broken though.  Lots going on.  On an extreme level if this is a habit (meaning: often/always responding poorly to change)"
"How do I get my 18 month old daughter to be okay?
She’s very attached to her mamma to where she will violently freak out if I try doing anything with her. I want to be able to take the burden off my wife of having to deal with a screaming toddler 24/7. Once we leave and are in the car she’s fine but if she knows she’s In the other room in the house she will scream bloody murder and bang her head against the door like a horror movie. My wife is starting to get mad at me because she has to hear the screaming all of the time and my daughter only really acts this way with me. Am I doing something wrong?","Can’t you take her out to the park or something? Options I use…

 Sternly say daddy is here for you when you are ready to calm down,if you want a hug or comfort I’m here. 

If she’s not hurting herself then wait, if she’s not calm then. You can try saying something like, I know you love your mommy and your feeling some anxiety or frustration (label the feeling)  or just big feelings, but I love you too and I want to take a big breath together so we can both calm down, can you do that with me?. Then you can show her how to calm down and decrease the energy surge. 

If she doesn’t want to do anything then you wait and say again, I’m here for you if you need a hug because I see your upset. May not work at first but keep trying. 

Hope this helps and I hope this gets easier for you. It’s heartbreaking and stressful situation to be in."
"PS5 has became a nightmare, need advice.
Last Xmas my son got a PS5. I was against it to be honest but his dad enjoys gaming and they’d game together (had an old ps4 here) so his dad bought him one. 

We let him go on it for an hour a day, some days he didn’t want to go on it at all which sometimes stretched into weeks. Then his friends got a PS5 too, they all shared their names and they play together. Some were allowed to play all day so I thought I could be a bit lenient and let him play for more than an hour (also had a baby around the time so the extra peace was nice) 

For the past couple months it’s not been good… he has an attitude. I don’t know if it’s just 8yo boy retaliation or if it’s because of the PS5. I’m around when he plays it so I can hear what’s being said and sometimes his friends can be pretty vulgar, they’re allowed to swear too but my son knows that’s not allowed here. I’ll encourage him to come off if they’re all arguing (they all argue often about which game to play, who’s killed who etc) sometimes he will say XYZ is being mean to me, he told me he was going to XYZ, I pull the plug on it. 

It’s the school holidays here and we’ve been spending the weekends away and really cutting the PS5 out during the week by doing other things but honestly I am tired and need a break sometimes. So he’s been on it this week. I’ve just had a parent message me that their kid is upset because of what my son said (absolutely fair) he had actually sent a message that it’s better not repeating, his dad went through his messages and he’s sent several different ones to each one and they’ve been awful “I’ll do XYZ to you” and swearing. 

I just want to bin the thing but his dad said they’re all as bad as each other he’s been told off. As soon as Dad said “what have you been sending because XXX’s mother has messaged me” he burst out crying, quickly turned his PlayStation off and ran out of his room. His dad argues that kids will be kids and he’s obviously tested the waters by the messages and knows it’s wrong because of his reaction but I’m ready to just stop it all together.

Am I over reacting? What shall I change going forward? Do I go back to limiting it? School starts back tomorrow and when thinking about it I feel a bit guilty that after school they’ll all want to play and he won’t be able to but I don’t want my son to act like that.","I game, my hubs games and my kids game too. That being said, it's affecting him so it's time to cut it off until he understands how to properly behave 

I've played and witnessed plenty of call of duty lobbies and the things that come out of these little pre puberty voices is just wild to me. It doesn't seem to matter if they're 8, 18 or 88, gamers will say some downright awful things to each other. It surely doesn't mean you need to sit by and let your 8 year old hear and say these things. Take him out for lunch, just the two of you. Somewhere not too distracting. 

Just ask him if you can have a real conversation with him. Open and honest and tell him to ignore the mom/son thing for 10 minutes. Then just  talk to him

He's a preteen, walking into a world that you have to battle against other parents parenting and such. Try to level with him. You want to trust him and give him the option to enjoy things like games but he's gotta show he can handle it. 

That works with my kids. They are both 10. I literally just speak to them like I would a colleague I'm trying to guide/mentor. My kids just respond to it very well. It may not work for your kid. I'm not saying it's the right way. But it's one of the options you can try."
"Resources to teach kindergarteners to protect themselves from sexual predators
Hi parents, especially fellow mothers, I hope this post does not bring you unnecessary anxiety. As my daughter grows older and looking more and more like a little girl, I start having worries specifically about how I can teach her to protect herself. 

I had many unpleasant encounters when I was young and unfortunately I believe is a common experience among any girl and lady in the world. I didn’t have adults or resources teaching me the awareness of it, heck, I didn’t know child trafficking existed until I saw a documentary when I was in high school.

What resources or what search keywords can I use, so I can find a guide that helps me teach my child to protect herself at different age stage? Thank you.",Best help is: talk about secrets / privacy / surprises. Make sure your kid knows that adults trying to have her keep a secret is bad news.
"Handling 15 month old tantrums
I had yesterday a big tantrum from my daughter who is 15 months old now, and we, parents, are not sure how to handle them at this stage. My husband pushes the decisions to me because I’m a clinical psychology student, and “I must have read about this”, but truth is, I’ve learned precisely to not read much about parenting as that can make us overly controlling and obsessive. I prefer to trust my intuition. However, I could use some pointers from who has had young toddlers. 
Thing is, at 15 months old they are only starting to understand directions and a good portion of what we say, but it is not nearly enough yet to reason much with them, especially when they are in midst of a big tantrum. Last night, it was about not wanting to sit on the high chair or eat dinner. Some of it was because the schedule of the day got a bit derailed, so she was overtired and off the rails, which I completely get, and I tried to comfort her, but she still had to eat and allow me to care for her to go to sleep. Should I just offer whatever she’ll take in big tantrums? Or is that being too permissive? I don’t want to encourage picky eating just to avoid big tantrums, as she is already not the greatest eater. 
I guess my question is : in this in between age where they have already big frustrations and big emotions/ tantrums, but are still not big enough for us to talk to them effectively, what is the best course of action to help less than good days? Do I just offer comfort or whatever food/toy they want and let discipline for later or can I still be authoritative, and if so, how?","In theoment I'd remove her from the situation, help her calm down. And in the future when we know our schedule is going to be tight , figure out something quick amd easy for last meal.

99 percent of dealing with tantrums is prevention and managing the situation I have 1.5 year old daughter and this is how we do things. (*I have just realized I ended up writing a really long post. I hope some of it will be usefull to you.)


We try to have the same routine everyday when it comes to meals, nap time and bedtime, because anything else is a recipe for a difficulty or a complete disaster. Usually she always has food put in front before she gets ravenously hungry and is in bed before she is overtired. However, as you said, sometimes things happen that disrupt the routine.


Whenever I suspect that my kid is having a tantrum or is getting moody because she's hungry or thirsty, I don't even try to address whatever triggered the tantrum but go straight to solving the problem, which is hunger or thirst. In practice that means that I give her or even directly ""stick into her mouth"" a piece of bread or a bite of a banana or something similarly simple, that is within reach. No matter where we are. Then I offer her some more and once her brain registers that eating is actually what she needs, she calms down enough that I can direct her to the table for a meal. 


If she is tired but also hasn't had dinner yet, I first try to give her something to eat. If she doesn't seem interested in food at all, I try with something enticing. For example a bite of melon or a raspberry or some other fruit she likes very much. After that I offer her other food. If that doesn't seem to work, because she wants to skip dinner and go to sleep instead, I offer her some milk, so that she at least gets something nutritious that fills her up a bit and that she doesn't wake in the middle of the night because of hunger. Then I take her to bed. I wouldn't try to force a tired kid to stay awake, when they are already half asleep, unless there was literally no other choice.


Another tip: if your kid doesn't want to eat but you believe it might be time for a meal, give her something to drink first. Sometimes kids don't realise they are thirsty or won't drink (enough) while they are preoccupied with playing or running around.


The one thing that never works is trying to reason with a kid that is in the middle of a full-blown tantrum. Their brain is not receptive for it, they need to calm down a bit first. 


Another thing I have noticed with my kid is, that when we come home after spending some time outside, she wants to have a few moments of peace/a few moments for herself before dinner. Giving her a few moments to cuddle with her favourite blanket or to play with some of her toys does wonders. She needs to just calm down a bit after the excitement of being outside before she is ready to eat. After that I can easily direct her towards the dining table.


Another things that seems to work well for us is that I always approach my daughter a few minutes before I want her to do something or go somewhere. I spend that time with her and let her finish whatever she's doing while gently telling her about what we'll be doing next. That way she's got time to process what is happening and is much more cooperative and calm during transitions from one activity to another.


A different situation is when the tantrum is not related to a too quick transition or to her basic needs not being met. 


In the situations where she is not allowed to do or have what she wants, I always:"
"Trying allergens
I have read every single book, downloaded the apps and talked to my ped and am still so scared to try the allergens with my daughter. 
She is about to be 8months and haven’t tried the top ones: eggs, peanuts, milk, soy etc.

She had/has a dairy allergy that started at about 2.5-3 months. She would get a pretty intense diaper rash. We tried introducing it back slowly at 6 months old with some milk that I pumped before I went dairy free and she ended up getting really gassy. So we put a hold on that. Overall I guess I am just wondering if others are feeling the same 😅 what helped that fear? I thought reading a lot on it would help and it did a little but not enough!",This gave me some comfort no one reacts the first time they try an allergen. Introducing them early reduces the risk of allergies. Do the pea sized amount and watch vigilantly for 10 minutes. You can do this. Maybe do it with another adult at home if you're worried.
"Debating to quit my Pottery Classes to focus on my family
Hi Everyone! Since May I’ve been lucky enough to take Pottery Classes at my local Ceramic Studio. I’m absolutely addicted and in love. If I could I would be doing that everyday all day. It fills me up with peace and joy. However, lately I’ve been feeling like taking the couple hours I have on a weekday and a weekend, have been messing up my family schedule especially dinner and bed time. It’s gotten better since I quite attending College in the spring but I haven’t had a break since last fall of back to back classes. I didn’t know what to do. The next lesson for me is a 12 week class commitment with more pieces to manage. From throwing, to trimming, baking and glazing it’s going to be lot. I’m hoping that if I do quit I’ll enjoy spending time with my son more, but I’m also worried that I’ll end up disappointed wanting to go back which I feel horrible for even saying. I’m a 24F SAHM which makes it hard for me to connect with people my age. My husband’s family carries a lot of drama I tend to get sucked into so getting to go to the studio already is healing to my soul. I feel like I finally met a community I fit into and would be so sad to let go. But, I also want to be a better mom for my son, and maybe have some more free time. Idk. What would you do? Have you been in this predicament? Am I making my life harder doing all this?","Spending every second with your child isn't going to make or break you as a mom

You have a hobby that you enjoy, it makes you happy. Your child should see that. One day they will have a extracurricular like sports and such. It's normal. 

You can't be each others whole world. That's not teaching them anything. Your not ignoring your kid or neglecting them. Your showing them that everyone has a passion and they should enjoy it if they can. You can't manage everyone's feelings

Dedicate time throughout the week foe something fun with just you and your kid. 

Don't get lost in just being a mom. Your kid will be fine. They are learning their own identity. Show them how it's done The importance of having a hobby in our generation that isn’t self destructive (substances) or financially a burden (again, substances, gambling, excessive spending) is more rare then you’d think. Don’t stop please, this is something you genuinely enjoy and a healthy outlet. It sounds like you’re a pillar in your home, shit doesn’t run the way it should without you. Which is Even more reason to grant yourself some “you time”. If you’re feeling guilty about leaving for lessons make a schedule and prep. 

Example: You have pottery on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday."
"8 year old doesn’t listen
I am a single mom and struggling with my 8 year old. 
She has been very rebellious and has been not listening at school as well as home.
We live next to her best friend and her best friend has been part of the issue. 
They go to the same school/ride the same bus/ play outside. I already have ground rules when she is out she needs to be seen at all times. 
Now that has changed because my daughter has not been obeying my rules. My daughter asked me if she can take her tablet outside and it is on a kids mode. I found that she was not using appropriately anyways although it has a pin. Which was weird. I was very upset. I took away the camera/video. The web browser on it. 
I have been upset like this before about the same thing happening where she doesn’t listen or obey my rules. 
I am the only parent. Her dad doesn’t care about her and never wanted her.
It makes it incredibly frustrating my daughter continues to do things I disapprove of. I gave her a stern talking to about how she is using the tablet and she had been very disobedient. 
She will not be going outside and will not be using a tablet anymore. It’s the same thing over and over. 
My daughter doesn’t listen or make sense of how bad things are if she doesn’t listen to me. 
I am considering heavily switching schools especially since there no after school care offered at her current school. I did mention that to my daughter as well and she didn’t like that. I have to because she needs after school care which her school doesn’t offer. I already don’t like her teacher. They keep putting her and the best friend in the same class. Which causes a lot of problems. I get messages how she is not behaving in class. She will test the other kids boundaries which is so not okay. My daughter has never been like that until she started hanging out with her best friend. I been trying to understand that is her best friend. They are just kids but, it’s giving me a lot of anxiety. I am doing the best I can to raise her. My discipline is not enough? I don’t know how to even make her understand that there are consequences. It really is like one thing i say goes out the other ear. I really want to put my head through a wall. 
I am not okay at all. Had the worst anxiety because it’s just been troubling to me.","Just general advice, be careful to always offer a carrot as well as a stick. Often, when kids get into trouble, parents crack down with harsher and harsher punishments. It can sometimes backfire and just breeds resentment. Do you know the best friends family and have you spent time with the child to gage her behavior? i think it might be helpful for you. Also is you child in any after school activities, or sports. That might help as well and separate her from this friend. Perhaps next school year you can make a request that that not be in the same class?

I personally think it will blow over. Parenting is so hard i hope you can get some help from family or friends from time to time."
"At an absolute loss with my daughter
My incredibly smart and curious child will. not. stop. getting up at night and wandering the house!!! She has been doing this for the better part of a year now. In addition to the obvious danger of her having free, unsupervised range of the house in the dark, im also concerned about the disruptions to her sleep patterns.  Short of locking her in from the outside, which we do not want to do because she's potty trained during the day and we are encouraging her to go at night (the toilet remains accessible on the other side of the baby gate), we have tried everything. Also, locking her in from the outside feels....idk. 

Child locks on the dooorknob? Absolutely 0 issue for her.

Baby gates? She kicks them over or climbs them.

We have an alexa light in her room and tried the red/ green method. She fully understands the concept and it worked for maybe a week. But now it's just creepy red mood lighting as she gets up and begins her nighttime adventure.

We have had conversations with her about why its not safe- she usually goes to the kitchen and finds something to eat. We've told her that its dangerous to eat alone in the middle of the night without mom or dad, because what if she choked? We also told her that if she gets that hungry in the middle of the night she can wake us up and we will help her find a snack and go back to sleep. She has never woken us up.

We dropped her nap in an attempt to let her be extra tired so she will sleep through the night- sometimes this works! But she will still get up 3-5 nights out of the week.

Tonight/ this morning I am at an absolute breaking point. I woke up at 0500 to nurse my 1 year old and this is what I found:

The 3 year old walking to her room with an arm full of toys from the living room. Hands sticky and covered in something which turned out to be egg yolk. Yall, she took the step stool from her bathroom, carried it to the kitchen, got the eggs out of the fridge, and cracked half of them onto a plate!  She also feasted on leftover pizza, ice cream and a bad of baby carrots. Cool cool cool. At least her midnight snack included a vegetable. She is a GREAT eater and at a healthy weight. She always eats a good portion of her food at dinnertime and has a small snack before bedtime.

But here's the extra terrifying part of what happened tonight: she got a hold of TWO steak knives. We are in the process of moving into a new house and the knife block was on the counter, pushed allll the way to a back corner where I stupidly thought it was totally inaccessible to her. Shes not injured at all, thank goodness. But I'm in tears and just so sick to my stomach over it. 

When I discovered all of this, I washed her hands, sent her back to her room, told her she was in big trouble but we'd talk about it later. 

Guys... what do we do? What's an appropriate punishment in this situation? Should we really lock her in from the outside until the habit is broken? Can I set up a cartoon style net in the hallway to scoop her up into the air if she steps on it???  Is building a Rapunzel style tower my only option to stop my raccoon-like child from her night time foraging? Any ideas are appreciated.","I feel like the only option is to lock from the outside or alarm the door. I would also alarm the outer doors if you haven't already. She sounds like she is one step away from trying to play outside. Yeah there is no, ""we didn't keep her safe because it didn't feel right"" with young toddlers. Be the parent and lock her in the room. I wouldn't even allow a toddler access to a full bathroom at that age at night, we put in a potty to empty in the morning due to flooding and toilet plus toy incidents."
"If you had a chill baby, what are they like now?
my daughter is 5 months and so chill! our first was not this way so this is new territory haha. she is such a calm baby in every way. she almost never cries, will lay on her play mat alone and be entertained, is chill during diaper changes and getting dressed, loves the bath and doesn’t mind her hair being washed, basically nothing bothers her. 
it’s great honestly but the only thing I find myself concerned with is how chill and calm she is. she does babble but not a ton and only screams on occasion whereas my older daughter screamed and babbled all the time at this age. she also doesn’t laugh much. she giggles here and there and smiles a lot but not really big laughs. she just in content being here lol. 

so i’m curious what she will be like as she turns to a toddler and little kid. soooo if you had a chill and content baby what were they like as toddlers and so on?","My first has been chill since day one! Literally since the womb. She’s currently a chill 4-year-old! 

Our second was doing flips daily in the womb and her 18 months of life have been wild 😂 My oldest was so chill as a baby and sounds exactly like yours. As a toddler she was also really well behaved. She pushed boundaries a bit but never went through a terrible twos or terrible threes stage. But when she turned 5 it’s like she made up for lost time. She has attitude to rival a teenager and her favorite phrase became “I’m bored”. She’s overall still a pretty good kid but no where near as easygoing as she was as a baby/toddler. She’s 8 now and never outgrew the attitude. God help me when she hits the teen years 😂"
"First day of Pre-primary
My daughter (4.5) starts pre-primary on Thursday, and while I have been trying to prepare myself, the anxiety has started to spike.


She is INSISTENT on taking the bus on the first day, and I don't want to deny her, but the ride is about an hour long.  She gets bored in the car with us on the 20 minute drive to town, and I'm worried she will get bored or scared in that time frame, and obviously there's nothing I can do to help her, plus she will be spending a whole day with new teachers and new kids.

She's can be a pretty nervous/sensitive kid, and has a history of getting in over her head.

I just need some ideas/advice/reassurance from somebody who's been here before.","It sounds like she is excited, which is a great sign!  Is there another child that she can buddy up with on the bus?  Or perhaps you can let her know that you need to take her the first day or two and then once she is used to the new school, you could add in the bus.  Even though she insists, you are the parent and know her best.  I struggle with anxiety, too, but I sometimes need to remind myself to not let my anxiety get in the way of something age-appropriate my kid wants to try. If it’s just boredom you are concerned about, you could send a book or two on the bus with her to look at if she gets bored.  Good luck! /u/Kindredatoner92, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"Advice on 3 year old bicker
I came across a situation in which I was unsure how to react properly.
I was at a children playground and my 3 year old daughter was playing on a slide. Another 3-4 year old child comes and aggressively pulls her away to go first. The mother of said child starts telling him not to pull other children. My daughter started looking at me while bursting to tears. What should I say to her? I promptly hugged her and told her it was nothing, but then I thought I shouldn't belittle her discomfort but I'm unsure on what I should've said.","You could tell her that it wasn't kind what the other kid did and that you understand she's upset about it, but to not let it ruin her fun! That's the tough thing. All kids that age are learning to share and be kind. Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't.

I'd tell her that the kid is still probably learning how to take his turn. Everyone is mean sometimes and it's a matter of how we learn to not do it that matters."
"Only child terrified of giving my child a sibling - warm and fuzzy sibling stories needed!
I was on the fence about having more than one, as I am an only child and know the pros and cons. I loved the attention as a child, but it was the loneliness as an adult - not having nieces and nephews, very small holiday gatherings, not having help with aging parents, etc. that made me consider having two. 

 I'm pregnant with #2, and while I'm super excited, I'm also mourning the loss of giving my firstborn my full attention and time. I am viewing this a lot from the lens of what she is losing/what I am taking away from her and feeling super guilty.  So I'd love to hear some stories about what she would be gaining - a new friend, a built in buddy, new opportunities and experiences rather than less?   Please share all your warm and fuzzy sibling moments, so I can come read your stories when I'm feeling guilty, and happy cry instead.","My two are best friends. My 10 year old walks her 8 year old brother to his class every morning before she goes to her own so she can give him a hug and tell him to have a great day. They were off school today and played together all day. Swimming, trampoline, biking, basketball, you name it. They do it all together. The younger one is a catcher for his baseball team. Why? Because his big sister is a pitcher for her softball team and he got used to catching to help her practice. They root for each other and make each other better. They have their own rooms but still have sleepovers with each other multiple times a week in each other's rooms. They watch all the same shows and make it a point to watch them together. They have a buddy for vacations, amusement park rides, and random family outings. 

I honestly believe the best gift I gave them was each other. They are each other's favorite person and I mean that literally. My son had to write about his favorite person for a ice breaker first day of school project and wrote about his sister. My guys are 4 and 8, and yes, there are the usually sibling nonsense and bickering.

But there is also a built-in playmate, helper. The past couple of days, my oldest has been reassuring his kid sister about school (her first day is tomorrow)  he is telling her all about the fun things that they do at the school, the kindergarten playground and all her teachers.

They have livingroom sleep overs once a month where they build a fort and ask for their air mattress and play games, make shadow puppets, eat snacks, and watch movies until they fall asleep."
"How to know when 4 year olds aggression is too much
My sons behaviour is increasingly worse and frequent towards me, dad and sister. Yesterday he threw his dinner plate at the wall because he didn’t like the clapping game I was playing with him. His dad asked if he wanted a bath or shower so he threw a pointed magnetic tile at his face and got him in the temple. Day before he ripped a handful of his sisters hair out from the roots because she hurt his finger accidentally. This made me feel horrible. He runs away from me in public spaces when he gets upset over something minor. I’ve tried everything in the book, boundaries, being firm, being calm and understanding, shouting because I can’t stand his sister being hurt anymore. There so much more he has done. Last week including let him take a centipede home so he threw it on the ground and stomped on it. Any advice on how to handle these big emotions? I need help as it’s making me depressed","Are you sure someone, somewhere is not abusing him? He definitely should be seeing a child psychologist. None of this seems like normal feelings.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Parenting) if you have any questions or concerns.* I have the same age gap with my kids and the 2.5 and 3 month old ages were by far the most challenging time of parenthood. 

My oldest was never tired. We went to the park each morning and even after walking a couple miles and he still wasn’t tired. My husband and I definitely were though. 

One thing that helped with his energy level was a toddler trampoline. Toddler trampolines have a bar they can hold onto on the top. He jumped on it a lot all through out the day. 

I will say give yourself some grace. It’s okay if the house is a bit messy and not everything is done. 

Schedule time with your partner without the kids. Even if it’s only once or twice a month a break is a good way for the two of you to reconnect. 

This too, shall pass. Your kids are little and eventually the younger one will be old enough to play with his older brother. 

And remember, you can never have too many videos or pictures. 🙂 My kids are 13 & 11 right now and it’s fun to look back on the times when they were babies.  I wish I would have done more videos. 

You got this!  Things will get better."
"Question for parents: baby height
I'm 6ft3/193cm, which is ""tall"" outside of a reddit post FOR tall people. I'm one of 5 brothers and we are all 6ft3/6ft4.

My son is 2 years old and is currently 78cm tall. His mother is 5ft2/157cm. I read online that at 2 years old, a boy is about half his fully grown height. That would make him a 5ft2 man.

Does anyone have any perspective on this? I cant imagine I was over 90cm at 2 years old.","""I read online that at 2 years old, a boy is about half his fully grown height.""

That's an old wives tale.  

Don't believe everything you read online. This is why if you want tall sons you need to marry a tall woman 💪 😂

No I’m joking! He definitely won’t be 5 foot 2!!! Probably somewhere in between your heights!"
"Big changes for 2 year old
Context: My mom and her partner, who my 2.5-year-old daughter loves and refers to as grandpa, recently moved in with us (me, 31 f, dad, 34 m, daughter, and baby son) temporarily while they look for a place of their own. The reason for the move is so that they can be closer to us to help with the kids. We also just welcomed our newborn son to the family 4 months ago, and our daughter is so good with him and loves him. 

New behaviors: my daughter has recently started having huge tantrums, saying no to everything, and crying excessively. She’s also seemed to regress with potty training, with which she was doing really well before Grammy and Grandpa moved in. She also wants me to do everything for her, which I try to do most of the time and am happy to do, but she yells “stop it, stop bothering me!!!!” To anyone (dad or Grammy) who are trying to help me with her OR her baby brother. I ask her if she needs some time to herself, and she always says no, but sometimes I’ll bring her upstairs away from everyone to calm down anyway, and that seems to help her. I assume most of these behaviors are due to the recent additions to our home, but not sure.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar, and what you did to best support your toddler? I feel like I’m failing her. I just don’t know what else to do.",Pretty standard for that age It was just 3 of you before
"Why does my 4yo hate his 2yo brother?  Please help😢
Any advice is greatly appreciated. Probably a silly question. My son (4.5) has literally always disliked his brother (2). He barely wants anything to do with him, doesn’t want him to play any games with him, doesn’t want to sit next to him on the couch and just generally yells at him every time our 2yo gets close to him or his toys. Our 2 year old isn’t perfect and does try to snatch toys and will occasionally break things. He’s 2 and struggles with impulse control. But our 4yo is just so unkind to him🥺 He doesn’t speak to anyone like that at Kindy nor our friends and family. Just his brother. Even when our youngest was a baby he never wanted to hold him or cuddle him. 

We are constantly trying to model how to speak kindly to our family and reminding him to not yell at him. And trying to foster games they can both play together. My husband is super close to his siblings and my MIL said they were never like this. 

Will he ever start liking him? Will they ever be best friends? My only child heart hurts. He’s sooo lucky to have a brother. I know he’s only 4 but hopefully he appreciates it one day.","In Siblings Without Rivalry they explain it like this: 


Imagine one day your husband comes home and goes, hey, good news, I'm getting a new wife in a few months! I mean, I promise I'll still love you just as much as her. Obviously I'll have to make her the top priority for a few years as she settles in. So we won't really have any time just for us anymore. But I'm sure you two will get along great!


Would you be best friends with your husband's new wife? I think you should respect the 4-year-old child's desire to keep a distance from his younger brother.

But you should make him polite. 

Whether they will become friends is not something you can control. They are all independent individuals."
"Forcing my son to shower
My son spent all day on a farm. He played in a kiddie pool, splash pad, jumper etc. he was barefoot the majority of the day. There was no exception when it came to showering. He was EXHAUSTED by the end of the night. He never stopped playing - literally from 3pm to 10pm. I already know he doesn’t like the bathtub in this house because it’s stained. It’s not dirty but it’s stained (not my house ) . Last time time he fought me in the bath but I was still able to clean him up.

Last night - he was screaming bloody murder when I was trying to get him in the shower . My husband told me to not shower him and I feel like he made things worse because we weren’t on the same page about it. He didn’t even want me to help me because he didn’t agree to it.

So yes being 8 months pregnant - I forced my son in the shower . Held him down . Hosed him down . Washed his hair , body etc in 1 minute. He was going crazy . I had to hop in the shower so I wouldn’t slip.

Was I wrong for wanting to clean him up ???? T","I found the first tick on my daughter after a day of playing outside for a couple hours... I let bath time/showertime slide that night and didn't find it until morning time. So sometimes cleaning is necessary I would've done the same. Being out and in germs, chlorine, is a non-negotiable."
"Stuttering beginning to fade
Stuttering beginning to fade

Hi there, 

My son is four and has been stuttering for a little over a year we've gone to speech therapy and we went with the approach of how to normalize it etc and he has done wonderfully. The one year anniversary of him stuttering was at the end of May and in the last month or so his stuttering has become extremely mild and non-existent on some days... There is a family history of stuttering but I'm wondering if this is normal? Is it possible that he could grow out of this? A year ago he could barely get a word out, but now it is so mild. You wouldn't even know it was a stutter unless you were really paying attention for it. 

He is starting school for the first time and I'm worried that it's all going to come back due to the stress of it all. I wonder if I should wait and hold him back to see if the stuttering goes away completely first.","SLP here! No medical advice but look up “developmental disfluency.” Depending on what’s going on with your kiddo, this may be the case. It also may be that he’s done really well with therapy and your family support and has gained lots of skills. Disfluency may recur most don’t go away entirely if it’s a true neurogenic disfluency. Early intervention like you’ve had with him attending therapy is great, and will help him whether it recurs as he ages or not! I’d talk to his SLP about your concerns and see what their opinion is!"
"Gift ideas for kid friend's mum who has been looking after my daughter
Through our own bad planning, we have a couple of weeks with no childcare for my 4 yo. Her best friend's mum, being the saint that she is, offered and has been looking after her (with her BFF) for the last week. What gift can I get her to show our appreciation? She's a stay at home mum if it helps with ideas. 

We have offered unlimited babysitting, but I'm also after something physical that I can gift her. TIA!","I’d do a spa day for her and the BFF. Offer to watch the kids on the day that works for her to go get pampered. If money is tight for her I would give her money or a gift card for a grocery store or something that will be helpful to her. If she is fine moneywise, a gift card for something else, something specific if you know what she likes or something generic if you don't."
"Thoughts on homeschooling
I just read a post on a different subreddit - the post was not about kids, but OP mentioned in it that her kids are homeschooled. Everyone in the comments latched onto that detail, and kept telling OP to 'stop isolating the kids'. 

I had positive experiences growing up in public school, but my brother was bullied quite badly, and had a hard time in school.

My daughter is still too young for school, but I've always been of the opinion that homeschooling would be more positive for kids, as long as they have recreational activities outside of the home with other children. 

Since school is a collection of random children from all walks of life, I feel that our children are more likely to be exposed to children from dysfunctional or abusive homes in school, which leads to bullying. 

However, with homeschooling, our child's exposure to other kids would mostly be in their recreational activities (music class, gymnastics, sports, or whatever else they're into) so they're going to have more positive experiences with like-minded children who share the same interests, and are productively working toward the same goals in their time spent together, as opposed to random interactions with kids at school during recess or lunch breaks. 

Being around like-minded children working toward similar goals in shared activities is the better social practice to prepare them for adulthood, because it more closely mirrors the social dynamics they will experience in the workplace. As adults, we don't just stand in a park socializing with everyone, which is the dynamic kids are practicing at school 😂.

Lastly, I feel that parents who have their kids in productive recreational activities are more likely to be involved in their kids' lives and interests, so those kids are probably less likely to be dysfunctional / bullies. 

In either dynamic, our children will befriend other kids, and opt to spend time with the kids they prefer outside of the school or recreational activities, so either way they will build real friendships over time. I am just thinking in terms of children spending time with large groups of children, and learning those initial social behaviours. 

Is my opinion an unpopular one, and why? 

Edited to add : 

By ""all walks of life"" I didn't mean different cultures. I meant dysfunctional homes where parents have substance abuse issues, or are abusive. The homes that produce more bullies, are the homes where children are unhappy, and unfulfilled.

In terms of cultural diversity (at least where I live) recreational activities are full of every race and cultural background, it's not a ""white"" thing to sign your kids up for activities that they're interested in, and I have tons of friends who are POC and their children are very active in recreational activities and sports. 

I didn't mention cultural diversity in my original post because where we live, their exposure to different cultures, races and religious beliefs would be the same, regardless of whether they had access to other kids via the school system, or via recreational activities.","""Since school is a collection of random children from all walks of life, I feel that our children are more likely to be exposed to children from dysfunctional homes in school, which leads to bullying."" 

I like my kids exposed to people from all walks of life, from different places, different intellectual capabilities, and being part of the community. I am a teacher. I have never seen homeschooling work out in a way where the kids weren't at least a little behind whether that be academically, emotionally, or socially. It could be my area. We live in a state ranked among the best for public schools so parents who homeschool instead are off their rocker most of the time. 

I think it can be the right choice in severe situations but is the least ideal school choice to raise a well rounded and successful adult.

Note: I am not changing my mind so if you want to reply about why homeschooling is great, I don't care and won't read your comment :)"
"Has anyone's kid severely changed from baby to toddler?
My son (3.5yo) used to be the the most relaxed and easy going baby. He never cried, was never clingy, slept amazingly, and was just happy all the time. He used to crawl up to anyone and smiled at every person. My husband and I used to say how lucky we are because of how easy he was, and we expected the first year to be hard. i felt guilty during mothers group because everyone was so exhausted, and i just had this magic happy baby. He then started getting a little whingy and winey from 1.5 and since he turned 2, he's completely the opposite. He's always whinging, always complaining, and never happy with anything. He's super stand-offish and takes a long time to warm up wherever we go. He's stubborn and has a fierce anger in him (which is odd because husband and I are calm and chill), he whinges all day long. 
Is this normal toddler behaviour? I just don't understand how my incredibly happy and outgoing baby has changed so much?","Its normal. The (in)famous rebellious toddler phase. Test phase for rebellious teenager. Normal. It ends around 5. It gets worse beforehand (3.5-4.5 was the worst for us). Everything is a phase, even the good stuff!

Consistency and love and firm boundaries and structure and date nights will get you through this."
"Embarrassed for reprimanding child at family event
This has been a continuous frustrating situation for me 40m and my wife 36f. Our oldest son 5m has a habit of not responding when we're looking for him. I know he can hear us but he just doesn't seem to understand or care when he's playing that he needs to respond to us calling for him. This regularly happens when we are at family gatherings. Tonight, at a family get together we were searching for him again while he was playing hide and seek with his cousins when he couldn't be found. Me and my wife were calling out ""This is your daddy, we're not playing, come out now"" and he still hid from us. After searching the whole house several times I hear laughter in the other room and when I got to where he was about 10 adults including my wife were surrounding him laughing & he was very proud of himself. I was not amused at all because I was really worried about him after the extensive search. I also felt betrayed and annoyed at the adults that thought it was funny that he had been hiding from his parents and now encouraging his bad behavior. Of course, I have to be the bad guy now so I pick him up and ask why he didn't come out when his mommy and daddy were searching for him. His smile turned to a frown and got really quiet and the laughter stopped. He mumbles a few words under his breath and made an excuse that he thought we were someone else. I explain again that he needs to answer us when we are calling for him and put him down. I didn't give him time out or yell at him or anything but I feel like such an A-hole for coming in while everyone was having a good time and reprimanding my child.

Am I wrong for doing this or were the other adults wrong for laughing and cheering when he was found? I feel like I failed as a parent and made myself look like a crazy person in front of everyone. But at the same time this is a regular occurrence and its very scary when your child goes missing like that. We can't find our son and no one seems to care. I feel like the other parents & adults around our family can be so unhelpful and I don't really know what to do and feel like I'm not handling this reoccurring situation well.","You did just fine, and I would let the adults know, ""this is actually a problem we've been trying to solve at home, next time please don't make it a joke.""

But I would go back to him later on at home and tell him that if he doesn't start answering you when you call for him, he's not going to be allowed out of your sight. Then if necessary, have him spend a full day having to stay right beside one of you. He'll get the picture! We had a similar issue and a child psychologist said to tell the child you’re going to practice responding. Then like 50x a day you call the child and they have to respond immediately. If they don’t you correct them. But basically you’re training them to “hear” you.  It actually helped big time for us."
"5 month old will only sleep on stomach
So my daughter was an amazing sleeper when she was born until 4 months and then she wouldn’t sleep unless she was touching me. Shes now 5 1/2 months and for the last week or so shes finally staying asleep when I put her down but I have to do it on her side and eventually she’ll roll onto her stomach. She can roll from back to belly herself but she can’t roll back once she’s on her belly so I worry about her when I go to sleep. I should mention she is sleeping on a mat on the living room floor and I’m on the couch as shes too old for her moses basket but as soon as I try lower her into the bassinet she wakes up but we will fight one battle at a

They’re somewhat controversial since they’re not really needed, expensive when bought ‘new’,and the risk of the little one throwing up and laying their face in it is still the same.

 But I was in the same situation as you and they gave me peace of mind. Yes, once baby can get there on their own it is safe to let them be. But It is recommended to always put baby down on their back and let them roll on their own."

"31 weeks pregnant and mu son got me already dreading the 1-2 transition
I am almost 31 weeks pregnant with my second son. My first is 4.5 and up until a couple of months ago, he was so happy about having a baby brother. In fact, even before I got pregnant, he would ask me about when we would become a family of four and specifically ask for a brother. But his behavior has changed a lot in the past few months and I am now very scared of the transition period once the baby is here. 

I know having a new sibling is a big transition for kids, so I was expecting him to regress once the baby is born, but to be honest, I didn’t expect this transition period to start during my pregnancy. He used to be a very well behaved child, maybe a little bit more emotionally aware than his peers. He is also the only grandchild in the family, the only child amongst our friend group as most of our friends are either single or without kids. So he is used to being the center of attention all the time. And he’s very much aware that this will be over once his brother is here.

So for the past few months, even though we spent all of the summer together (I don’t work and spent every hour of every day during the summer holidays with him), went on two big vacations as a family of 3, he seems to not get enough of me and gets really mad when my/or my husband’s attention is slightly on something else. I can play with him for hours and if I take a 5 minute break, he starts screaming, crying, yelling that I am a bad mom and he hates me. He doesn’t care when I get very tired from playing with him and tell him that I need to lie down for a couple of minutes. He doesn’t let me and my husband speak when he gets home from work. Even screen time doesn’t work as he wants our attention to be on whatever he’s watching and constantly asks us to watch with him.

I have been taking him to play therapy weekly to help him better express his emotions, and his therapist also observes that he is very attached to me (in a healthy way she says) and very jealous of his unborn brother, even though we have been acting really cool about the whole pregnancy to avoid sibling jealousy. She has given me some tips on how to encourage a secure attachment and assured me that as long as we have established a secure attachment, we can set some boundaries with him but every boundary we have tried to set backfires on us. 

So as I said, I am very scared of how things will go when the baby is here. I am sad that I spent all this pregnancy focusing on my son’s feelings and not prioritising my own needs at all. I am starting to feel doubtful about our decision to have another baby, which really makes me upset. 

A part of me hopes maybe him having all these big feelings in advance will help him better adjust once the baby is here? Is this a realistic expectation or is this period simply a trailer of how things will go once I give birth?

I am open to any insights, suggesions or support from parents who have been through a similar change!

TIA","What boundaries have you set and how have they backfired? How does he react to not getting a toy or treat he wants? He won’t have constant access to you with a newborn so I think he needs more practice with frustration tolerance now. You are allowed to talk to your husband as adults and he will have to wait sometimes, maybe starting there because it’s more tangible and you’re both adults. Is he in preschool?

He said that the simply comforts himself with statistics when it comes to the topic of school violence (specifically school shootings).  I forget the exact data but he once sent me a mail, which to summarize, basically said that since Columbine, there are around 20 shooting deaths per year in US schools and around 50 million kids in school.  So he said that statistically, the chance that it will happen to one of his kids is .0000004% and he tries to focus on that any time he gets anxious.

"Potty Training - kid wont tell anyone else
Hi Guys. My child is 2 years old and I started potty training her at 14 months. Now she only wear diapers at night. She is fully potty trained

I just encountered an issue which I wasnt even aware of. I had to spend 4 days at hospice and in these four days my mother and sister were taking care of my child. What happened was, she did not tell anyone one when she needed to go to toilet and kept soiling her self and crying. What to do?

How can I encourabge her to tell family that she needs to go potty??.","Were they prompting her to go? Is she in daycare with other caregivers or just you?

How does she tell *you* she needs to go?

I think if you see your mom and sister a lot, maybe just have them start asking her if she needs to go and she'll start to realize everyone pees and poops and it's okay! You just keep telling her. Give her situations where she needs to tell someone else. Also make sure that family members are asking her if she needs to go at regular intervals. It’s very normal that she is more shy with people that aren’t you. You have to teach her like you did with potty training or anything else"

"What to do about this girl's attitude...how to strike a balance
My daughter is 1.5. You tell her to do something/not do something and sometimes she listens. Other times, she literally just stares you dead in the eye with a straight face and won't do anything. Or she will keep doing what you told her not to do. And stare. Or give a big, mischievous grin. 

What do I do? I actually don't want to completely discourage this behavior because I never want her to be a pushover, goodie two shoes. I love her attitude but....sometimes she has got to listen and not be disrespectful... ;-)

And I never had to deal with this type of stuff with my son. He had almost none of this type of attitude until at least 2/2.5.","She’s just learning. She isn’t being disrespectful.

"Wwyd YMCA policy being enforced unevenly
We are members of our local YMCA and frequently use the facilities for a variety of things, but especially the indoor and outdoor pools. 

Our 4yr old is in the process of learning to swim. She has sensory difficulties and though we tried swim lessons they weren't particularly helpful and she wasn't able to finish the class because she became too overwhelmed/upset. 

Even before that I was taking her to the pool regularly and  working with her myself. We ustilize a kickboard, although sometimes the YMCA staff won't allow us to use the ones they have there. I got her a ""swim pack"" at the recommendation of the YMCA swim instructor, and it was incredibly helpful. It's been a year and a half and she can now swim independently with the swim pack on with 3 of the foam pieces. It's designed to make the child more bouyant, not to make them float like a life jacket. I am always with her in the pool. We can remove foam pieces as she gets stronger and eventually she won't need it. 

All this past summer, about half of the time while at the outdoor pool, the lifeguards tell us she cannot use it as only uscg approved floatation devices are allowed. Which is incredibly frustrating, but it's the policy so fine. 

Here's my frustration; the policy is that children under 8 must use a uscg approved floatation device and be within arms reach of their parents. And that is not enforced at all. Children as young as or younger than my child run around the pool and you can't even tell who/where their parents are. Most wear puddle jumpers which are approved, but terrible for learning to swim. Some wear nothing at all. And the lifeguards don't say a thing. 

I don't mind following a policy if it's enforced equally. I think it's a dumb policy as it doesn't allow children to actually learn to swim except for in the swim classes that you have to pay for. As it stands it's almost impossible for me to teach my child to swim. With the policy not being enforced for the rest of the members I feel like it would be very reasonable for them to make an exception for us considering we are actively with our daughter and she is objectively safer than most of the kids in the pool with the approved floatation devices. 

I don't want to be difficult, but I don't know how to proceed. How am I supposed to teach my child to swim without access to a private pool? I there a way I can fight the policy?","You need to focus on your kid not what everyone else is doing. They do not allow items not approved by USCG. Your flotation item is not. 


The kids who are wearing flotation devices are all wearing USCG approved flotation devices? So they are enforcing the policy.


As far as you and I know the kids who aren't wearing anything are proficient swimmers and have demonstrated that. My 4yo can swim independently; not sure about ymca but our pool allows kids who can swim independently to be in the water without a parent"

"Which is worse in terms of child safety - my husband and I can’t agree.
My husband thinks not filling up petrol for car is just as bad as leaving our toddler in the car when paying for petrol. 

I think the risk of running out of petrol while incredibly frustrating is able to be addressed. 

Leaving a child in the car is unnecessary risk that can have catastrophic consequences (kidnapping, carjacking etc)

I need to know if my thinking completely off base?


Context: I forgot to fill up petrol tank and the car was near empty this morning so my husband had to fill up before dropping my son at daycare. 

He left our son in the car when he went to pay for petrol, it’s is a large patrol station and pumps are a fair distance from the service desk - which he has previously promised me he would not do under any circumstances.","Why couldn’t he just take the child inside to pay for the fuel. I don’t understand leaving your child in a car The risk of running out of gas isn’t just incredibly frustrating, it can be dangerous. Just as leaving a toddler in the car unattended can be dangerous. However both are only “dangerous” under certain circumstances. Running in to pay for gas for 1 min with locked doors and plenty of people around isn’t ideal, but risks are pretty low. It’s pretty unlikely that no one is going to notice someone trying to break into the vehicle, and it won’t be fast either. Running out of gas somewhere with no gas stations or help nearby is also a pretty low risk. I would personally bring the kid inside to pay for gas, but I would pretty pissed that the tank is low, I am on a tight schedule to get the kid to childcare, and now not only do i have to spend time getting gas but I also have to spend time getting the kid in and out of the carseat again"
"Advice for how to handle this situation
My daughter (6) has an acquaintance (same age) who I don’t know how to handle. She comes over almost daily after school to play, which was fine until it wasn’t. Over the past month, this friend has broken my daughter’s toys, pulled her hair, broke a sentimental item of my great grandmother’s, and tore up 2 sets of our blinds, so we started saying she’s an outside only friend. 

Well that didn’t help. She pours out bubbles, broke our sprinkler, ripped the net on our trampoline, crushes up chalk, etc. 


She has zero social boundaries. If someone doesn’t hear something she says the first time, or if she interrupts, she screams. She has sent my daughter into tears because of name-calling, saying she’s rude because she won’t share toys (because she’s learned sharing with her means they’ll likely get broken). 

Her mother has never offered to pay to fix/replace anything she has broken. I have given so much grace to this child, but I am at my wits end. Her mom has told me she is on the spectrum, so they do little to enforce boundaries or rules since she just breaks them and “doesn’t understand the consequences of her actions.” She has came over before and when something happened, I told her it’s time to go home for the day, to which she responded her mom told her to come to our house so she could run errands. Sure enough, that’s exactly what happened. 

I just don’t know what to do. She is not a good friend and seems to have minimal parental guidance which doesn’t help. I hate to be the bad person and say no you’re no longer allowed to play together, but that’s pretty much where I’m at. My daughter doesn’t really enjoy playing with her either, it’s more out of obligation to be nice to her.","... just stop the play dates? You are the adult, you put your foot down, especially since your daughter doesn't enjoy the time with the other girl? Are you trying to raise a doormat by example? [removed]"
"Taking a kid with a cold to a play date - am I in the wrong here?
I am having a disagreement with my husband and honestly feeling really pissed off right now. My husband made a play date arrangement a few days ago with the mom of twins who are the same age as our son. My kid has comw down with some kind of head cold, he’s got a very congested and runny nose, sneezing and coughing a bit, but no fever and doesn’t really seem to be acting like he feels unwell besides maybe being a little tired. Last night he kept waking up because of the congestion and I ended up sitting up and holding him to sleep for a long time because being inclined seemed to help.

I told my husband we’ll need to cancel the play date because I don’t want to get the other kids sick. He outwardly said okay but then apparently never cancelled. He just came up to me after my son’s nap to say he was going to get him ready to go, despite that we already talked about cancelling, and said that since our son outwardly seems to be feeling okay (ya know, minus all the sneezing and coughing and congestion and snot and him being kind of low energy 🙄) that he thought it would be fine to still take him to the play date.

Am I over reacting here? I mean it’s one thing to be accidentally exposed to illness, but to deliberately bring a sick kid to a play date with other kids? That just seems so rude to me. What is the etiquette there? We have only met up with these parents one other time outside of organized play classes so it’s not like they’re close friends who wouldn’t be bothered by my son’s cold.","Your husband’s a jerk. At the very minimum, he should have been fully honest with the friends about all of his symptoms and let them decide if they want to risk their kid getting sick.

Honestly, if I were this other family and your kid came over sick without me having a heads up, I probably would not try to continue to have a friendship in the future Your husband is a jerk! No one wants a sick child and the other person has twins! Toddlers cough and sneeze on people put their germy hand on toys that go in other children’s mouth. No just no!
At very least call and say your child has a cold and let other mom decide.  I would not be happy if you showed up to a playdate with a child with a cold or any illness."
"My son (5) is putting a strain on our marriage with his difficult behaviour
I have three kids (8F, M5, and M3). My middle child’s behaviour dominates everything. The other two are normal good kids. But middle child’s is absolutely breaking us.

He’s fine when he’s getting everything he wants. But as soon as we say no, or try to discipline him all hell breaks loose. He starts with baby voices and whining. Then false apologising to try and manipulate us, then one minute later the screaming and shouting starts. We try to ignore it and focus on good behaviour but he escalates again - by screaming as loud as possible and whining repetitively to aggravate us. He gives no fucks where we are or who we are with. He will also get extremely violent especially with his little brother, pulling hair, slapping, raining punches, smashing things. 

Honestly, it’s getting to the point where I say to myself ‘I regret having this child / god I hate him’ and I physically want to harm him - especially when he lashes out at my youngest. At this point I’m raging and starting to find it harder and harder to control myself. To be clear, the way I think and feel when I’m like this is just internal. We don’t hit or get aggressive with our kids. 

We’ve tried disciplining him by taking things away (tablet is max 30 mins a day and is often completely removed due to behaviour). We have a loving home with age appropriate activities for the kids. We’ve tried explaining why what he does is not the best way to deal with things. We’ve tried talking but we are met with nonchalance and silence. Occasionally he will say whatever he needs to say to get a treat or something we’ve taken away. 

This is causing friction in my marriage as he plays us off against each other by being contrite and sweet to one of us and ignoring the other who he argued with. We then argue (never in front of the kids) over how to handle things. Dad tries to ignore the bad and reward the good, mum (me) wants accountability and changes. 

I’m not worried about who is right or wrong I’m just broken. Venting. Wondering how we can help his behaviour. We have no idea if this is normal at age 5?? He’s always been difficult since about the age of 2. 

I’m sad my other 2 kids often have to take a back seat due to his meltdowns. The youngest kid is also showing signs of copying these awful behaviours. 

As for school, useless. No transparency and met with ‘no he’s fine’ when I bring his behaviour at home up to the teacher. I’ve applied for an autism assessment but it will take months/years and in the meantime I’ve got to find a strategy that works because we cannot cope with him. 

Has anyone experience with a child / dynamic like this?","So, I taught fourth grade for a really long time, and one year at parent teacher conferences I had a mother very sternly tell me that her daughter was just a little kid and even if she’s behaving badly and yelling and screaming and saying rude things and not following directions, I need to be patient with her because she’s just a little kid and I’m a grown-up, and she deserves to be treated nicely and yada yada yada. I was baffled by this and told her that I had never had a reason to reprimand her daughter at all, she’s always quiet and polite and cooperative. The mother was shocked. She said, “but…she behaves so badly at home!” So I wouldn’t assume that the school is not being transparent or being dishonest with you. Some kids just behave very differently at school than at home. I do hope you figure out what’s going on with your kid though, and you can get them some help so that they and you can be happier. Do you ever spend time just with him individually?

Also do you show equal or more part love/compassion for how much you are disciplining him?

This all sounds like attention seeking behavior, especially since it doesn’t happen at school. You had another kid right at the start of his testing phase (starting around 2.) He probably FELT ignored ended up figuring out negative behavior was getting him attention.  

I would highly suggest being very intentional about giving him positive attention and love. Also remove as many triggers as you can for a while. If the tablet is an issue maybe it shouldn’t be in your lives for a while. For kids in general if they don’t perceive equal parts love/discipline you will start to see negative behaviors stem from the situation."
"Toddler abroad for a month without me...really struggling
My son (2M), husband (29M), and I (30F) all went to his home country for a trip. I am the sole breadwinner and could only get two weeks off of work. But my husband and I decided it would be a good idea for he and my son to stay longer to visit with family, learn the language, and give my husband a bit of a break (he's a stay at home dad with no family support in our hometown). The two of them are staying for almost another month (4 weeks).

I knew I was going to miss them, but I wanted my son to be connected to his culture and family. My mother in law used to take my husband back to their home country for a few months each summer while my father in law stayed behind in our current country to work and would only join them at the end for a few weeks, so it was packaged as a pretty normal thing. And it sounds like those trips were most of my husband's core childhood memories. I want my son to be able to have those memories too.

But I don't know how I'm going to keep doing this. It's been a week, and it hasn't gotten any easier. If anything, I miss them even more. I cry all the time, I'm barely sleeping, the place is a mess because I don't have the energy to do anything, and I'm generally miserable. The pregnancy hormones probably aren't helping either (currently second trimester). Our five year anniversary was this weekend, and whenever I think about it I cry. It was either be there for the anniversary or my son's second birthday with the way dates worked out, and I chose my son's birthday. We celebrated the anniversary early, so I thought I'd be fine, but I was very wrong.

I'm really lost. We moved to our current city a little over a year ago, and I'm always at work or with my son, so I haven't made any friends here I can lean on. And I'm estranged from my parents. I don't ever remember feeling so alone. I know I signed up for this-my husband didn't push it or anything-and I know military parents have to be away from their kids for a lot longer, so I feel like a bit of a baby, but this is so so hard for me. And because I underestimated how hard it would be, I think that makes it even harder.

My son started out asking for me all the time, but now it seems like he's moved on. When I facetime now he says ""no mama, only nanna."" He's growing and learning so much, which is amazing, but all I can think about is that it's all happening without me. He's going to come back a completely new kid, and he's not going to feel like he can trust me anymore since I left him.

I've talked to my husband about some of this, but I don't want to worry him too much. There's not really anything he can do at this point. And he's already agreed we're never doing this again. But I still have three more weeks to survive of this. Someone please help me figure out how. I feel like an empty shell without my guys. Has anyone gone through something like this? What did you do?","It’s hard being away from your baby. Try to do things that you enjoy and remind yourself it’s only a temporary separation. You’ll be reunited before you know it! Wishing you comfort 🥺 I just got back from our home country with my 22 month old toddler. We were there for 5 weeks and my husband couldn’t join us because he just started a new job. Our daughter didn’t really want to FaceTime dad while we were away, I think she missed him too much and it was easier to focus on what was happening there. She was super excited to travel back and when the plane landed she screamed “dad”, laughed, and clapped. Then she was shy for the first hug but when we got home 20 minutes later, she just wanted to play with dad.

I’m sure this sucks for you and it must be really hard, but in three weeks you will just continue from where you left off!"
"Very shy child
I'm a 33 year old father to twin girls, 4 years old, nearly 5.

One of my daughters is very social, she talks to people, she makes friends easily, she's also a little shy but she warms up to people very quickly.

My other daughter on the other hand sinks into herself whenever someone talks to her, she tucks her chin and hides behind me or my partner.

It's quite heartbreaking to see her this way, we take her to do social activities like football and swimming classes, we often take them to parks and other social environments to get her used to it, but nothing seems to be working.

She doesn't like being encouraged and often just ignores me when I try to give her advice and doesn't want to hear any of it. I know it eats her up because she desperately wants to play with other kids and make friends but she just won't do it.

Can anyone give me some advice on how to handle this situation, I really just want to see her happy and not so in her own head all of the time, I want her to be herself freely without fear.","I don't have an answer for you but would this bother you as much if there wasn't a more social twin to directly compare her too? 


Twins are hard, especially same sex because it's simply too easy to compare. I was the unbearably shy twin. When I say unbearable I mean unbearable. I preferred animals and books to people. There were times my dad would yell at me for it, because he desperately wanted me to fit in. That did not help. As an adult I have a normal social life. 


Also they are still babies. When they get to kindergarten I would split them up and see how she does in that environment. See what her teachers say. Try not to compare. Hey /u/Hairy-Temperature262! It looks like you might be new here.

"Adult shampoo
My daughter is 7 and has thin curly hair that gets tangled very easy (it’s also on the dry side.) I was thinking of trying a shampoo I use, but I’m not sure if it’ll affect her hair. Would it be safe to use a non kid shampoo for her?","Kids shampoos vs adult shampoo (generally, not all the time!) come down to a few things. Being “tear free”, smelling like bubble gum, 2/3/17-in-one products or any combination there of. A lot of adult shampoo/conditioner has a targeted purpose retain color, fix damage, add moisture, dandruff, etc. 

I would say as long as it’s not a produce that’s “clarifying” in nature (because those can burn little scalps!) and you are careful about the eyes, it’s probably fine. Double check ingredients if you are unsure."
"Difficult 5 year old
Need some advice from parents who have dealt with this and had results.

My son is five and is very difficult. He is very smart in ways that he understands things that you would never think he is paying attention to, and you can’t get anything past him. He is very deep and empathetic, sensitive. He likes to feel like he is helping. But he won’t learn simple things like letters, or numbers. Sometimes he just doesn’t want to seems like. We learned this week that his vision has been bad he is farsighted and is +2. I’m hoping this will help with his learning once we get his glasses in .. Has any one had this happen and seen a change in behavior? 

Also, 
Everything every day is a battle simple things like brushing your teeth, or just anything I ask him to do (or not to do) is like a war. He never just goes with the flow, or is easy going. How did you deal with a child like this. I know it is his personality and it’s not like I can change that. I’m worried his stubbornness is going to get the best of him. . especially when he’s older 

How do I get him to listen to me, follow instructions and want to learn.","I have a super smart 5 year old who CANNOT be ordered to do anything. He needs convincing. Maybe yours is the same? This is a tough age for setting expectations and maturity to follow through. My son did not like drawing or coloring or anything academic going into Kindergarten, despite a lot of trying. 

I did a few things to tackle this, and one of the easiest things was really committing to goal-based behavior, like using a star chart. It looks like a calendar on a poster board; basically, all of the behaviors I want him to do (brush teeth, put shoes away, wash hands, color a picture, do 5 addition problems) are a star sticker for that day. You can write the goal or use a picture. 

Then there are rewards for meeting goals, like 50 stars is a new small toy, etc. And it really helps to *not* give rewards except when earned. In a cool way, it sounds like your son might come to enjoy the challenges. We started basic, adding achievements and behaviors as we went. Over time, this was a really helpful part of resetting expectations for us. 

Good luck OP, it gets better"
"3 year old refusing meat / “animal” shaped products
My daughter just turned 3 and although she’s been quite the picky eater since turning two, she recently started refusing to eat chicken and ground beef which were her staples. Not only is she not wanting to eat meat (which she doesn’t realize comes from actual animals at this point), she also won’t eat animal crackers despite liking them because she doesn’t want to eat animals. we don’t buy her crackers shaped as animals anymore, such as the trader joe’s chocolate cats or animal graham crackers bc all of a sudden she doesn’t want to eat something shaped as an animal. she had a little bear birthday party and didn’t want to eat the little bear character cookies for this reason as well.

her grandma keeps making comments saying it’s weird she is like that and she’s never met another child who won’t eat animal shaped things for this reason. she also says “oh her heart will be so broken when she learns what chicken is”

this totally isn’t a huge issue right now, she is so sweet and obsessed with animals so it makes sense for her to feel this way (although I think it’s kind of young). I’m just slightly worried about her learning that meat is from animals and I don’t know what I would feed her because she is so picky right now. has anyone else experienced this with their little one? how do I go about it?","This is not weird at all.

My daughter doesn't like most meat, started at about 3, she's 5 now.  She will eat animal shaped things, but she just doesn't enjoy meat.

We are not forcing her.  There are plenty of other sources of protein. My daughter eats edamame, cheese, and nuts. Some people just care more about animals. It’s sweet and you should be proud of her empathy. I get the animal shaped thing is annoying, maybe just keep reinforcing its pretend and for fun, like when you make a smiley face pancake you’re not eating a person. But maybe you should try out some vegetarian meals just in case she keeps up this trait in the future :) Feel free to dm for recipes!!"
"Oh the places you’ll go
I remember years ago seeing a post either on tumblr or Twitter about parents buying a copy of oh the places you’ll go and giving it to their kids teachers to write a note in it at the end of the school year and it would be given to the kid as a graduation gift. I always like that idea but as an educator I always thought it was too much after elementary school kids have multiple teachers then and teachers have too much to deal with. But I still love the thought behind it. So my question is do you think if would be just as impactful and sweet if instead of teachers and stuff. My daughter’s father and I wrote her a note each year on her birthday in her copy of the book and it is her gift on her 18th birthday since that’s when she’s an “adult”.","Hey /u/Hairy-Loquat-9219!

"How do I get my 4 year old to listen.. like AT ALL!!
Title say it all but basically my 4 year old will simply not listen to anything I say unless I raise my voice or completely lose it. I try asking properly i.e. get his attention, down to his level, be clear in my statements etc. I always give a heads up like "" ok, it's bath time in 5 minutes so when I say it's time, you need to get in the bath, is that clear?"" He'll with ignore me (and if so, I will get his attention again and re-phrase it so I am not repeating) or else will say ok but then when I say ok bath time he just doesn't move or finds a million and one excuses. Until I finally raise my voice and say something along the lines of OK. BATH TIME. NOW! and then he'll go ""ok ok"" as though meaning ok ok calm down woman (he obviously doesn't say that).

I am tired or bribing and threatening, I am tired of feeling invisible, I am worried I am raising a rude and arrogant child and someone who doesn't respect others. I hate having to shout but if I don't he simply won't listen. 

The worst part is when I have to do it at bedtime.. I always lay with him until he falls asleep and he will jump around, joke, invent things, everything but wind down and sleep. I have to (once again) raise my voice and say ok now we need to stop! I said that's enough! Which makes me feel SO BAD for sending him to sleep with me raising my voice as the last thing in his head.. 

Please share any tips that can help because I am honestly not liking this version of a mother I am becoming. I do not need to threaten my son that I will take his toys away if he doesn't pick them up or that I will not allow him to watch TV if he doesn't eat his dinner! Especially when it comes to food, I've always tried to get him to listen to his body but if I don't push him into taking every single bite, he will honestly be running on air...","I don't know what it looks like in your home but from what you've described, I am getting the impression that he knows it isn't serious until you raise your voice. If he won't turn off the TV to eat dinner no matter how many times you tell him until finally you yell ""Turn off the TV and eat or you won't have TV for the rest of the night!"" Well, now a consequence is involved. When you ask him calmly he still has some room to ignore you but knows that once the raised voice comes out you mean business. You need to always mean business. You can tell him in your nice voice ""The TV needs to turn off so you can have dinner. If the TV is too much of a distraction, then it means we need a break and won't be watching for the rest of the night."" And then follow through. He still doesnt listen? Turn it off and put the remote up. Right now he thinks that until you yell you won't actually do anything about it. This is one example but I mean it with anything. You dont have to yell about consequences to enforce them. He gets one warning, he makes his choice, and you respond to that choice. It seems like it's a power struggle with you almost begging him to listen and negotiating and finally yell and put your foot down and so he is aware it doesnt matter if he listens until that point. Put your foot down from the beginning. The bedtime thing: if my 8 year old messes about when he's meant to be going to sleep I tell him I will not sit with him if he messes around, and I absolutely follow through on that threat. Needless to say he very rarely misbehaves when it's sleep time now. However, this works for us because he wants me to sit with him until he falls asleep, this is less likely to work if your kid isn't actually that bothered about having someone there as they fall asleep"

He also lied to me this morning about talking to someone when I could hear him and said it was someone from school and later admitted it wasn’t.

No Idea if this is the right sub for this but I’m frustrated. 

Do kids really not hangout anymore? My son tries to hangout with his friends, they make plans and nothing ever comes of it. 

Is this normal?","This is the biggest mystery to me. I have a teenage and pre-teenage daughter. I’m all of the time encouraging them to invite their friends over. Offering to have a fire, order pizza, etc. They almost always brush me off, replying with “eh, maybe, I don’t know”. Then nothing ever comes of it. It’s sad for me to watch.

I should add that they both have numerous friends, they just never seem interested in physically hanging out. My daughter does occasionally.

"Music recommendations for 18-month old boy
Want to start getting my son used to listening to real music (it's all been wheels on the bus and teletubbies so far). 

Music has always been a passion of mine and I'd like my boy to develop a keen ear for music too, and I figured it's probably good to start early.

Being a first time father I've never really considered what aspects of the music I love might appeal to a young child, but I suppose a good beat and catchy hook will do it. My mind just seems to go blank when I go to choose something and then I put something on and he just cries until I change it. (I suppose he's not ready for Nirvana and Soundgarden yet).

Have any parents out there got any song recs that instantly get your kid bopping? I developed my own music tastes in the 90s as a teen, so I'm thinking music along the lines of grunge/alternative and/or 60s/70s rock too. The only one I did find so far was jump around by house of pain. Really looking to find enough to make up a good playlist on Youtube that we can listen to together. 

Thanks in advance!","My husband found out early on that my son loved Black Betty by Ram Jam. He would instantly stop fussing and just bounce around. We found that both kids responded well to songs with good drum beats. I'm not musically inclined so you will have to forgive my explanation, but anything with a dramatic change in tempo or build up resonated with them. So there were lots of Queen, Journey and 80's ballads played in our house. I’ve been listening to loads of different kinds of music with my 2.5 year old. Of course we do this nursery rhymes stuff, but that’s gets old very fast for adult ears. 

On the kids music side, soundtracks like Moana etc. are more palatable. I highly recommend Nick Cope (British children’s musician). His songs are fun for everyone. 

We do a lot of classical, and relaxing jazz"
"My tweenage son called me out for looking something up on Google Gemini.
Somewhere my daughter (9) learned about polio. She brought it up at the dinner table and asked if we knew about it. My wife confirmed and told her that we have an uncle and and aunt that had polio as children. I told her that she doesn't have to worry about polio because she was  vaccinated and it's been eradicated in the US. She asked if other countries still have it. I didn't know the answer so I pulled it my cell phone and asked Google Gemini what countries still have polio. I started reading the response and my son (12) jumped in with all of the dripping saracasm he could muster and said ""According to AI...""

I said, ""That's fair."" And then tapped on a more reliable source to continue reading the answer. (Afghanistan and Pakistan if you are interested.)

I was quite proud of both of them.","I'm right there with your kid, I miss Google being the answer finding machine and not the answer giving machine. 

Back in the day, I remember being told Wikipedia wasn't a reliable source because it was community edited, but my argument was it gave sources you could follow back to verify. 

The AI results we currently get don't give sources and hide their bias and I hate it. I was picking image tokens to use for our D&D session, and my 14 year old son pointed out that the one I liked was AI.  I asked ""so what?"", and he said ""don't use it, no one put any effort into it"". 

Like you, I was proud of him."
"Uproot kid to become homeowners, or stay put in a state where we will never own a home?
My son is in 5th grade, loves his friends and loves our neighborhood. He’s very happy. My husband and and I would like to leave our current HCOL state to become first time homeowners in another state. I’ve explained this to my son. He gets a little bummed, but then very excited at the idea of having a big house with a big backyard and his own room. Nothing is getting cheaper. The market isn’t going to crash. A big reason for wanting to make the move next summer, is because it will be his first year of middle school, which may be tough, but at least he is starting at the beginning with the rest of the 3 feeder schools that won’t know each other. Lastly, he is very outgoing, makes friends easily, but I still don’t want to hurt him or ruin his life or self esteem. Advice?","Move. Kids are resilient and he will adapt. Sounds like a better life with home ownership. 

This is not a child’s decision. It is an adult decision. Uproot kid to become homeowner. This is a silly question. Kids will make more friends. He'll be incredibly thankful in 30+ years when hes lined up to inherit a home instead of keeping some 5th grade friends thaat he wont remember when hes in college"
"How do i tell kids being mean to my kid to stop being an asshole?
For context, my daughter is 8 and was being picked on by boys down the street, probably 10 or 11 years old. Calling her names from a distance. I went down and told them to cut it out. 20 minutes later it happens again so i turn up the rage a bit and told them how tough they were from a distance but now they are quiet as could be. One of them was suuuuper mouthy and seemed like nothing i said would shut him up. Wondering how other parents handle this situation? I get that boys will be boys but im gonna stick up for my kid 100% of the time and there are only so many options when dealing with pre teens.","Controversial opinion that I'm sure will earn downvotes: I would give your daughter ammo and let her sling more hurtful insults back. This is how my mom taught us. She used to always tell me that bullies just need to feel the pain of their own medicine and that usually puts a stop to it. She was right every time. I never like to pick on anyone's physical appearance, but when it comes to my kid, shrug. For example; This older girl kept picking on me for my hairy legs when I was 8. My mom told me to tell her that ""I can shave my legs, but you can't shave off that big ugly nose."" I know it's horrible, but she asked for it and she never messed with me again after that. We rode the same bus all the way into high school. She never bothered me again and I was nice to her going forward. 

Those kids don't give a shit about you being upset with them. They probably find it funny. Speak with their parents."
"How should I tell my son about his dad?
So my ex boyfriend and I got pregnant a few months into knowing each other. We decided to try and build our family and be with each other. It was okay until I was 8 months pregnant and left after the emotional abuse turned physical. He was born in July with my last name & no father listed and because of everything that happened I am pursuing charges against his father for the abuse. So the father has not reached out whatsoever to attempt to connect with his son. Him and his family likely want nothing to do with us. I am also attempting to get child support from him once paternity is established by court. 

Anyways, assuming that everything goes well and his dad attempts to be in his son’s life one day, how would I go about telling my son what happened?
What do I even say when he’s old enough to realize he doesn’t have a father and asks about it? I really wouldn’t like to talk badly about his dad to him, but it would make me uncomfortable if his dad got visitation or custody and the unknown of if he is telling my son bad things about me which would be false. 

I guess I just don’t know what I should do when he’s old enough and asks. I could sprinkle some truth in there but also avoid speaking badly about him maybe? Or just be fully honest and say his own dad hit me when I was pregnant with him? 
Any advice would be helpful. I’m new at this, a first time single mom at 23 y/o. Thanks in advance","Dont hide the truth. 

Keep all your papers and records and show him when old enough if he wants proof

When hes younger and asks about him just say he wasn't nice and did bad things. [removed]"
"Keeping my 16 yo entitled daughter grounded
Keeping my entitled daughter grounded

First time posting in this reddit so please bare with me.  Divorced dad to a 16 yo daughter.  My daughter has a great heart but she's becoming very entitled.  Her mother and I have struggled with this the past few years and I'm stuck what to do.  My daughter suffers from high anxiety as well as poor focus. She got her license back in June and since then has totaled the car she got from her mom and been in two minor accidents with a car she was given by a friend.  I spent half the day today pulling dents and trying get the doors straight.  If you know anything about body work it's an ugly process and it usually looks worse before it gets better.  After grinding away some paint to weld onto the metal to straighter,  it's better but it's only step one.  Today when she went to take her car to work,  she asked if it would be fixed by tomorrow,  obviously not. Her next response was,  ""I have to drive my car like that to school?"". I was really taken aback by her attitude towards my hard work.  She goes to a school where money is plentiful and I certainly have the funds to buy her a new car,  but am I wrong for being so pissed by this attitude? I was raised blue collar by parents that worked hard for everything they wanted in life,  I am the same way.  I'm trying to teach her appreciation for things in life but she doesn't get it.  I hate her driving a beat up car but she did this to herself.  I know the comments she'll get from the other kids at school may be cruel and as her dad i don't want her to face that either. Very stuck right now.  Thanks for taking the time to read all this.","If she’s gotten into that many accidents within the first year of having her license she just isn’t ready to drive. Take that car away! No more car and no more driving at all without mom or dad in the passenger seat. She obviously doesn’t realize the severity of wrecking not one, but two cars. Tell her if she’s embarrassed by the state of the car, she should learn to be a better driver before being allowed to use another. Driving is a privilege. It’s been less than 3 months and she’s had 3 accidents? She’s not ready to drive."
"6 year old having a major attitude problem
Over the past few weeks my son has been having a major attitude problem. Just downright nasty and rude. Talking back, growling, rolling eyes, etc. He's always been a sensitive kid, but this is very new to us. It's almost like hes a teenager. It's making it very hard to be around him and do things with him because he's being so argumentative every step of the way, even when we do things he likes. I'm also pregnant and very hormonal so my patience isn't what it used to be and his mean words are really starting to impact me. I just want to know I'm not alone.","You’re not. My son calls me an “asshole,” but five or ten minutes later says, “Dad? I love you.”

"How much do you disclose about your financials?
My son was looking over my shoulder and saw the very expensive cost of his summer camp on their website: I was about to fill out the application for scholarship assistance, and was so laser focused on that that I didn’t see that he saw the cost.

His eyes lit up and he said “It costs that much?!” I told him that it does but we don’t pay that much, and not to worry about it.

He does get an allowance and gets a couple of bucks to throw out grandmas trash as well. He has an understanding of saving for what you want, and how much certain things cost, but I feel like this was for sure an eye opener.

I don’t want him to feel guilty. It’s not for him to worry about how we pay for his summer fun or anything else - that’s on us. 

So I guess my question is - how much about your household finances do you discuss or mention to your tween? My son is 11. Thanks!","Interesting question and I’m sure will have so many varied opinions.

My husband is from a working middle class family who had nice things, stable home, holidays etc. I came from a more poorer upbringing in social housing and money was very tight. My mum always told us about our money troubles, sometimes we’d come home and the tv in her room or the stereo would be gone, and she’d tell us she had to take it to cash converters for money to pay the rent. Things like that. Or “she spent her last $2 on a scratchie to try and win $50 to get us through”. So I have a lot of trauma around money. 

I do not want entitled kids. So I do share with them the cost of things. We don’t disclose what’s in our bank account. 

We make sacrifices as a family. For example last year we had a nicer holiday that was more expensive than usual with my husbands family when the kids wanted something or asked for a take away dinner or something"
"Daughter draws on herself.
Hey all! My daughter will be 6 in November and she’s a sweet, intelligent, shy, and mature child. She is also a wonderful artist. 

She started on paper but soon started to draw on herself—this was before preschool so I know she wasn’t influenced by other kids unless she picked it up elsewhere. At first I tried to enforce it; marker stays on paper. I’d wash off anything on the skin as soon as I saw it. She will still draw on paper and paints occasionally, however it quickly moves to her arm or thigh. 

I don’t know if it’s because she wants to show off her art, or what the cause is. I asked her, and she said she thinks it looks good. I think she’s very talented for her age, but I don’t know if this is an okay activity for a child to do. I’ve limited her to three “tattoos” a day, and she completely understands that she bathes daily and they get washed off. I definitely don’t want to make her feel ashamed of her art. We have it everywhere throughout the house and even in the car.",Kids will draw on themselves. Hell I was still drawing on myself when I was 16 years old cause I thought it was edgy and cool. I don’t see how this can negatively affect her in anyway. Shes just being expressive Oh …are there kids out there who don’t draw on themselves as soon as the textas or paint comes out?
"My kid’s teacher smokes in class
My child is going into first grade but he’s in a loop class, so he has the same teachers from last year. He stated he likes Ms.J but not Ms.E. Intrigued I was like why do you not like Ms.E? And he’s like she smokes in class. I’m like wow really that seems strange because smoking isn’t allowed in school (& she was pregnant too lol) and so I’m like I think you’re making it up. He’s getting mad and insists she’s sneaks it. So I go ok show me how does she smoke. He shows me and I nod and now i understand. I pull up this pic on my phone (someone using an inhaler)and ask him if this is what she’s doing and he’s like yeah exactly that! So people just so you know, you may not have the whole story from your child regarding their teacher. 🤪https://share.google/KR2lcODBYs5DquYRE","“Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and the baby looked at me.” I'm an ECE. My philosophy is I won't take everything your kid says about you at face value if you don't take everything your kid says about me at face value 😂

My favourite ""man, you were close but you got this all wrong"" moment was when one of my guys came up to me and said ""Miss Rock, 'Andy' said the N-word!"" 

I was shocked, not only because that's a hell of a word for a seven year old to drop, but also because I knew Andy. I knew his family. This was *not* in character. 

So I probed. Asked the kid to tell me *what* word. ""I don't want to say it!"" 

Ok. 

""Do you not want to say it because you're worried you'll get in trouble?"" 

""Yes.""

""Ok buddy. I won't make you say a word you don't want to say, but I will promise you that I won't give you any trouble if you do.""

Kid looks around, gets real close, and whispers...

""Andy ... He said.... Miss Rock, he said *nuts*.""

"Son made a poor decision
UPDATE: First and foremost, thank you to everyone for the feedback. When I initially posted this I was incredibly anxious because it had just happened, but after I took a few breaths and read some of the comments (and spoke to my own dad lol) I relaxed a bit. Basically it played out exactly as everyone expected, she was super cool about it. 

We went over and she showed us the damage, which was much smaller and easily reparable than what I’d imagined. My son took ownership of his mistake, apologized, and she joked about how he should be a baseball pitcher. She thinks she can repair it, declined his help, and said she doesn’t want any money. She thanked my son for being honest and told him that must have took a lot of courage, and she appreciates it. Turns out she used to be a therapist, which I imagine lends to her reaction to the situation, and worked specifically with boys my son’s age. We got to know each other and realized we have a lot in common, and she said she’s glad she got the chance to officially meet us. 

Everything is fine and I got to know a new neighbor. I’ve realized this also needs to be a learning lesson for me in not immediately assuming the worst. When we got home I thanked my son for being honest, gave him a hug, and told him I was proud of him.



My (32f) eleven year old son is a good kid. He doesn’t really get into trouble and tends to have a decent head on his shoulders. A few months ago we moved to a new town, and a lot of the folks in the neighborhood are older and more well off financially than we are. We’ve made friends with one of our neighbors who’s an older woman, and often greet other neighbors when passing by on walks or when headed out for work. It’s a quiet and safe neighborhood and we are really happy to be settling in here.
 
Fast forward to today, I hear my doorbell ring and see an older woman with a dog at my front door. I go out and she formally introduces herself, and mentions we’ve exchanged pleasantries before. She proceeds to show me a rock that apparently broke her mesh window screen and landed in her house. Her window was open so no broken glass (thank god) but obviously still concerning. I told her that I could look at my ring camera because at this point I didn’t even think this had to do with my kid, but she explained it came from the back end of the house. 

Immediately my heart sank, my son had briefly been out back and I knew this had to have been him. She told me that the screen needed to be replaced and because she’s a renter, she plans to let her landlord know to figure out how to go about replacing it. I told her I need to discuss with my son and, if it was him, then we absolutely would pay for the screen. She said she raised 3 kids of her own and clarified that she wasn’t accusing him, but it was heavily implied, which is totally fair. Somewhat condescendingly she said she planned to ask the elderly neighbor we’ve befriended if she did it, and I told her there’s no way (and no reason) she would have done that. She told me to come by later to look at it after I’ve had a chance to discuss it with my son, I gave her my number and we parted ways. 

My partner brings my son to the living room and he admits he was throwing rocks, but that he was only throwing it at the tree in our backyard…sigh. We had a discussion about how he shouldn’t even be throwing rocks to begin with, which he already knows, how this could have played out much worse (the lady was in the room when it happened so it could have hit her) and he acknowledged that this was a really poor choice on his part. The plan is for all of us to go over so he can apologize to her and we can work out the details of paying for a new screen. He will be paying us back for whatever the cost of the screen is by doing work around the house, and he’s temporarily lost the privilege of being alone in the backyard. 

I’m really concerned that this is going to cause issues since we’re new to the neighborhood. I really love it here and don’t want to be thought of as a bad neighbor, I’m scared this is going to get back to our landlord and upset them. Like I said in the start of the post, we live in a town where most people are well off and we don’t fit into that category. I have pink hair and tattoos and I already worry that people here view me in a different light because of that. I do believe the incident was an accident, my kid has never maliciously caused harm, and I think this was a dumb kid thing that will be a huge learning lesson for him. I’m hoping someone here can reassure me that this isn’t the end of the world, I don’t want people thinking my son is a bad kid when he’s really not. 

I’m incredibly stressed out and just keep thinking how this is going to make us the neighborhood pariahs. Any advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. Aside from having him take accountability and apologize to her, and him paying to replace the screen, is there anything more I can do to reassure her that this isn’t a pattern of behavior for her to be concerned about?","More important than others thinking your kid is a bad kid is if he thinks of himself as a bad kid after this. He will need support to retain his self respect after doing stupid things, like the rest of us. As for the neighbors.... if they don't understand that kids do stupid things, you don't want to know them anyway. He shouldn’t think it’s the end of the world or that he is bad The life lesson is People make mistakes and do stupid things and learn from it and move on"
"Intense separation anxiety in 2.5 y/o
My son is a deep feeler which is something I often love about him- passion and gusto! It often seems disproportionate and really intense regarding his relationship with his dad/ my husband. 

Our son screams, cries, and sometimes panics when Dad leaves the room or he doesn’t know where he went. Showers are horrendous. My husband could be showering and our son cries and screams even though he can see him through the glass. He is also very verbal and can articulate, “no daddy please don’t shower, get out of the shower daddy.” 

He is respectful of bathroom privacy when we have guests and we’ve tried to calmly explain that “daddy needs private time too.” But it goes beyond that. While we were loading up the car for an adventure Dad stepped outside to get things ready and he started crying again, “Where did daddy go????” 

Even at tumbling, something he loves and is excited for, my husband stayed behind a few minutes to adjust the car seat and when we got in he had to run back out because he said  “concerned about daddy.” 

My hypothesis is that because I’m the primary caretaker he longs for more daddy time. My husband does a pretty great job at 1:1 time, playing, bedtime but it’s definitely a lot less than he gets with me all day. 

We try our best to explain when dad has to leave or do something and I let him have his big feelings, but it is very nonstop and extreme. This has been happening for months. 

Have you been in a similar situation? What might you recommend?",
"My daughter is scared to start school next week
She's going into middle school in an inner-city school district. We attended her new student orientation and school tour a couple days ago. She was super nervous when we first walked in and she saw the metal detectors, caging everywhere, cameras set up at pretty much every possible angle. Not going to lie, even I felt uneasy about it and I went to this school back in the late 90s, it had it's issues back then but it wasn't bad enough to be set up like a damn prison. She's a quiet kid, really smart that she's taking classes with upperclassmen, and she's also small for her age so there was no doubt she's going to be an easy target. Anyway, we did a mock change of class routine - and in between ""classes"" she had to use the bathroom. We weren't paying too close attention but apparently another new girl followed her in there and cornered her, threatening that if she showed up next week she'd get jumped. She didn't tell us what happened until after we left and got back home. 

I'm at a loss what to do; we can't afford private school and her mom and I both work full-time so home schooling isn't possible.","As a former teacher, honestly, I would be pulling my kid out and trying to open enroll in a nearby school or district. If that’s not possible, I would look into online schooling. I normally don’t love to advocate for online school, but it’s better than sending your kid to a school that even *you* feel uneasy in. This is one of the few cases that doesn’t seem like a parental overreaction. I wouldn’t expect your daughter to last very long at this school whether you try or not, given your description of her personality.

I taught for a brief time in a school similar to this. All of the kids were suffering, whether it be the “bad” kids that fell into gang violence, kids that were forced to take on a parental role to their younger siblings and support them with full time jobs, or just quiet kids getting bullied by other kids that were dealing with unimaginable home lives. Violence can and does happen in these schools. Not a single one of these kids deserves to be in that environment, including yours. I would’ve done anything to help these kids, but I couldn’t save them all. Luckily, you have the opportunity to protect your child from this environment. Is online school an option? If you and she are comfortable leaving her being home alone while the parents work, could that be an option? Is she self-motivated/focused enough to be in charge of her own workload? (I would have been terrible at that, but my brother thrived doing self-directed schooling.)"
"Scared of death ever since daughter
Every since having my daughter that will now be 3 ive been terrified every single day thinking what if I leave her the day tomorrow due to leaving this earth. It haunts me every single day and any little pain I get I freak out. Does anyone else experience this?","Yes. I get all cold blooded if I think about my death or my 2 or 3 year old or my husbands death.

Live it well, because any day could be our last. I tell myself that to try to cherish it all. 

Anxiety about death sucks This is what led to me being diagnosed with OCD. I became so obsessed with the thought that there could be something wrong with me that I would spend hours every day Googling symptoms I had, going to doctors, etc."
"Sports and kids
Would appreciate feedback, opinions, and advise as to how to navigate kids sports. To give some context, I have a 7 year old son, we live in a small rural’ish town (we are not originally from here), and my son shows interest in sports and has been in various sports since he was 3 (soccer, hockey, swimming, baseball). I am blown away with how quickly these leagues become competitive and have observed cliques being formed already where groups of parents like to hang out together and usually this is the groupings of these more competitive kids/parents. It seems like opportunities for these kids open up and others are being excluded - the most recent came up in baseball where a “select” boys team in this age range was put together by a couple dads and there was no try outs, it was just formed, while all the other kids of various skills were in the typical minor teams. It’s a small town so it created some waves. I am a bit older, not overly social nor is my husband, so honestly most the time we are oblivious or just don’t care. Well this past week it came to my attention that there was registration and tryouts occurring for a rep baseball team (2026 season but try outs in early September), and couldn’t find info anywhere (email, socials, website). When an email came out this morning that they reopened registration, stating it had been closed but they will reopen it, I responded to the president of the minor baseball Association with a very polite but direct email indicating that I wasn’t sure of the root of this problem, but it appeared that select families and kids were being notified of the tryouts while others weren’t being included. I stated in that email that if I overlooked information that that’s on me, but really was asking what the root of this issue was and expressing it didn’t land well as it appeared select kids/families were aware. He responded pretty harshly saying “you shouldn’t be thinking this way“ and reported that the main issue was technology related. I’m now sitting here, stirring, part of myself regrets sending that email as I’m an anxious person to begin with, while part of me is trying to reassure myself it’s okay to raise concerns, and that his reaction is likely not solely akin response to my question but I’m guessing other concerns that have been raised. Did I over-step? Maybe I just need thicker skin!? Ugh. I hate overthinking things.","/u/Lilly_519, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"My daughter’s cat unexpectedly passed away - she’s 7 how do I tell her? TW
I am still processing this myself. It was shocking, he did it to himself and I’m not even sure how he managed it. It was horrible. 

We found him in a dumpster bottle fed him. He was literally her best friend she carried him everywhere and he was happily with her everywhere. Objectively he was the sweetest cat. 

I have been thinking all morning how to tell her but I can’t figure it out.  He was indoor only because “inside keeps them safe” but inside did not keep him safe. 

I want to tell her the truth,
vaguely skim over the how, 
and then comfort her. 

I am not going to lie to her that he got outside and disappeared. 

I wish this was easier.","I would tell her that he got sick suddenly and died. It seems you don’t want to tell her about the accident. Then just hold her and cry with her. Never tell anyone what really happened. Other people can be morons and you don't want your child overhearing something horrific. Tell you're daughter the gentlest version you can, even if that involves some lying (about gory and horrific specifics) . Don't tell her the full or even partial truth, this is your burden, not hers. Tell relatives, friends etc the same sanitised version."
"At my wits’ end with my 5y/o’s sleep. Need advice.
My son will be 5 in November, and I’m feeling desperate to solve his sleep issues. 

1) He has long insisted that a parent (9/10 times his father) sit with him on his bed until he falls asleep.
2) He refuses to even get into bed or start his nightly routine until super late (9pm at the earliest)
3) Every single night for the past year- without fail! - he wakes up and climbs into our bed in the middle of the night and proceeds to flail around and disrupt our sleep.
4) as soon as he feels one of us get out of the bed in the morning, he pops up and won’t go back to sleep.

Why this is a problem: We both need to wake up before 6am to get ready for work in the mornings, and are often exhausted as a result of late nights and sleep disruptions. And so is he!! We’re all crabby and pissed off.

Complicating factors:
- we live in a small, old apartment in NYC. Our two bedrooms are right next to each other. Save for the bathroom, there are no sectioned off rooms — just one living area.
- he shares a room with his 1.5 year old sister

This to say, we can’t let him tantrum it out without waking up his sister and causing a nightmare for everyone. There’s nowhere to take him when he screams and cries because daddy needs to go to sleep before him, or he wants to fall asleep in our bed instead of his, or we try to take him back to his room in the middle of the night, or he’s woken up early and now he’s just marching all over the place talking loudly….

What the hell can we do here. I just snapped and majorly lost my cool tonight and tried to wrestle him back into his bed. And of course he screamed and woke his sister. 

He’s afraid of the dark and being alone, so my solutions so far are…
- I let him turn all the hall lights on and keep his bedroom door open so it’s bright af
- I remind him we are literally never more than like 20 feet from him at any given time. It’s a SMALL APARTMENT!!

Please help. I’m starting to resent my kid.","He should not be in charge of any of this. Move your younger child into your room in their crib, etc and gate off your 5 year old.
You need to stop giving in to his demands it will take some time but if you are firm and consistent, it can happen.
Talk with his doctor."
"I am scared my daughter is becoming a bully
I have 3 kids. My oldest daughter is 8, my middle daughter is 6, and my son is 4. 

My middle child has progressively become less caring about other people. She is super manipulative and acts like a bully. She will try to get other people to do everything for her, and she makes everyone's life a nightmare when she doesn't get what she wants. My husband and I do not give in to her manipulation, but pretty much everyone else in her life does. Sometimes when we disagree, we will tell her to go think about it in her room and take a minute to cool off. She will scream bloody murder the entire time and will scream ""stop talking about me"" when we are not talking about her. 

Her default response to being called out on bad behavior is to say, ""I am just the worst person and no one loves me"", which I just calmly tell her isn't true. She likes to say, ""Everything is my fault"" or ""You think I am the baddest kid ever"". All of this is kind of out of left field because we are careful about our words to her when she is being mean or hurtful to someone, we say something like, ""It's not kind to make fun of your brother. That hurts his feelings"". We are not accusatory or mean. We don't scream and yell. It just feels so weird to me. I know she is only 6, but she is extremely intelligent and honestly kind of scares me at times. I don't want to let this behavior continue because she will have a pretty hard time having friends and relationships if she acts like this. I find myself wondering where she even learned this behavior and what I can do to put a stop to it. I just feel like I am failing as a parent right now.","While her behavior needs addressing, I don't think she is anywhere close to bullying based on your description, at least.

How does she behave in school?

ETA: Have you consulted with a childhood behavioral specialist? If this was an adult she’d be on anti-depressants. The sayings she says are common signs of depre** in adults. Reach for help."
"Determining what toys to store/donate
My daughter is 10.5 with a very small room. She’s a bit immature for her age and has difficulty with change sometimes. We are getting ready to move and need to start sorting through our attic and living spaces. I have held onto a lot of my daughter’s toys because at one point we thought we would be able to have a second, but the second never came. I want to streamline the stuff down, but was interested in how to determine what to keep and what to donate. My thought was for her to pick 4-5 of her favorite Barbies and I can store them for her, but then there’s all the other stuff. I don’t want to eliminate her things too early, even though she hadn’t played with the things for a year before it went into the attic. Thoughts?","I think your plan of letting her pick a few favorites is solid. I’d maybe also try the “box method” , put the rest in a box out of sight for a few months. If she asks for something, you know it still matters to her. If she doesn’t even remember what’s in there, it’s probably safe to donate. That way you’re not taking things away too fast, and she still feels some control in the process. Hey /u/someonesarah! It looks like you might be new here.

"Out after dark
I’m at the lake with my kids. 9 & 11. The sun has gone down. My son wants to go with his friend (and these 3 other kids he just met) to his friends Dads cabin. All the boys have a bike but mine. I don’t have a contact number or an address. My son doesn’t have a phone. My sons Dad has his friends Dads number and address but the kids are in my care atm. I text my son’s Dad…he says he’ll be fine. I’m not okay with this. I let him go despite my concerns. I get back to the trailer and now my sons Dad (I’m not saying partner atm because we haven’t seen eye to eye for years) is telling me that I should let our daughter go rollerblade with her friends. It’s dark out…despite some of the street lights…and she is only 9. Now at this point I tell him how I feel. He thinks I’m controlling and they’ll be fine. On the way back to the trailer he shares with my son our argument. My son came into the trailer and said I should hear him out. My son felt sorry for him and now has sided with him. I didn’t know we were now sharing our adult matters with our children. He can be the fun parent but I want to know am I crazy to not want my 9 and 11 year old to be out after sunset with no adult supervision?","Your main issue is your relationship with the father. By 9 years old I was running around in the canyon behind our house by myself well past dark.

"Working parents - drop your routines PLEASE
I have a 13 month old and I went back to work full time when he was 10 months old. He goes to nursery 3 full days a week, grandparents have him one day and then me and my husband split a Friday around our shifts. He works different shifts each week which means I’m on my own in the evenings every other week. 

I drop my son off at nursery at 8am, drive straight to work, leave work at 5:30pm, pick up my son on the way home, give him dinner at 6/6:30ish, bath and ready for bed by 7:30/8pm at which point I then have to shower myself, cook myself dinner and eat, tidy up, wash dishes, prepare lunch etc for the next day, do laundry etc etc. 

How in the hell does anyone manage to keep on top of everything whilst working full time or even part time for that matter? Like when am I supposed to do the food shop, clean the house plus all of the above? Not to mention having any smidgen of time to do anything  extracurricular such as go to the gym, get my hair done, look after myself or just chill for like 5 mins??? I was prepared that parenthood would look like this but nothing can prepare you for the never ending mental load and having to fit 986372 tasks into 24 hours whilst trying to spend time with your child so it doesn’t feel like he gets home from nursery and I put him straight to bed. 

Please drop your routines because I am STRESSED and I can’t be the only one. I am also fully aware I only have one child and I cannot even fathom how people deal with this having multiple children at school and having to deal with packed lunches, school drop off/pick ups etc etc.","One thing that massively helped me was eating dinner with my daughter. That way I don’t have to sort my own dinner once she’s in bed, plus it’s nice to have family meals. 

I’m hybrid so WFH 3 days a week, but days I’m in the office I either put something in the slow cooker before I leave or we have something quick when I get home. You can also meal prep/freeze meals to make it quicker. Why don't you eat dinner with your child? You could alternate cooking with your husband, split the chores etc. He does the food shop one week, you do it the following week. Same with all other home and family tasks."
"[Advice] Please help - my son's friends STINK
My 15yo son is fortunate enough to have a large, close knit group of guy friends that hang out often. His friends are all great kids and we have no problem with them coming over. We host at least a couple of sleepovers/video game nights/study groups a month, and everyone is always well behaved and polite.

Our only problem with hosting the group is that many of them flat out stink. They smell VERY strongly of BO and dirty hair. It overpowers the house when everyone is here and it will linger after everyone goes home. 

My son, for his own part, takes pretty good care with his personal hygiene: he showers daily (twice if he does something active), and always washes his hair. He has a skincare routine and has been wearing deodorant and body spray since he was 12 or 13 and noticed on his own that he was getting ""rank"" and oily a few hours after showering. He and I both stay on top of his laundry. He never re-wears clothes before washing them or even reuses towels/washclothes. I am fairly confident it's not him. 

I genuinely like all of these kids, and I don't want to single anyone out or embarass them. I also don't feel like it's my place to approach someone else's child about their BO. Nor do I want to pressure my son to do so on my behalf. What can do to curtail the stink without wrecking my son's friendships?","This is SO common. Teenage boy funk is…. Unavoidable. I remember my brothers friends being the same way.

Honestly? I’d just walk in the room and go “it smells like a locker room in here! Y’all need to shower more” And hand them all deodorant and body wash and let it go. 

It WILL get better. Hormones are wild It seems that teen boys travel in packs. Bless their hearts, they just smell. Awful. 

Get an air purifier for the room where they hang out..it DOES wonders! Trust me. The Dyson air purifier knocks out the smell from six teen athletes post practice in a matter of minutes. THAT should be in their advertisements.

Anywho, I have a kid who’s worn deodorant since 1st grade, showers at least once a day, uses the high-end “acidic” body washes, whole body deodorant, fancy face washes, detoxes laundry, etc. but it’s no use. Dermatologist says he’s got a weird bacterial biome living in his skin, and bleach baths kill everything. 🙄

We know he smells..he’s trying EVERYTHING to keep it in check, but it still gets out of control throughout the day. He’s probably a hyperhidrosis kid, but just not diagnosed. He’s always been super sweaty.

My advice…Be kind. They probably know they smell. We joke about it with the pack of teens who crash here when I turn the air purifier UP. 

I wouldn’t address it unless you notice the smell at the beginning of the day or their home life may suggest they need some support. In most cases, I’d assume their deodorant is losing the battle of teen hormones. Which isn’t good, but it’s better than the next step.. Axe body sprays. I’m not sure which is worse… but bath and body works now has a manly body spray line 🤪 God help us all in the phase."
"Should we tell my son that his dog died?
Hello all. 

There's been a lot of incidents happening in our life at the moment. And I'm wondering how upfront/protective I should be of my 15 year old son. 

His mom and I are not together. And conjointly we've lost multiple pets in the last month plus some other negative experiences. 

It started about a month ago when his cat passed away (at his mom's house). 

Then a week ago, my dad had to be hospitalized. Thankfully he's been released now. 

Last week, on Thursday, his mom had a medical emergency where it seemed she was having a heart attack. He had to rush her to the hospital.   
She was released the next day, but she's in delicate condition and it was obviously a very scary experience for him. 

On Saturday, my wife and I had a house fire and we lost our two cats. Which were as much his pets as ours. (He also lost everything that was in his room at my place.)   
That same night, his elderly dog ran away. 

On Thursday, his mom went for a drive and found the elderly dog dead in a ditch. She has not told him yet.   
Friday Morning, while my son was at school. His other dog got out of the gate and got hit by a car.   
This one will likely be extra hard as his previous dog also got hit by a car when he accidentally let it out.   


He's been staying at my grand dad's and sister since Friday. So he doesn't know the elderly dog was found or that his other dog was killed by a car. 

His mom and I were talking about whether he should be told about the two of them. 

I think the uncertainty may be harder for him than the news. 

But he's lost 5 pets in the last month, 4 of them in the last week. Plus the extra stress of his mom's heart condition.   
I'm worried about all the pain this is causing him at once. 

Any advice would be appreciated. 

  
(For clarity, his mom and I don't live in the same country. He lives with her but comes and stays with me during his summer breaks and sometimes longer.)

Update: just an update since I'm getting a lot of similar comments. 
He started therapy this week to deal with it all. 
Also it's good to see everyone agrees on telling him. It's what we planned to do, but it's good to get confirmation.","I think you gotta put yourself in his shoes what you would feel if your parents where not honest with you about soemthing like this 


You cant shield him from pain he will experience this just like every human does but maybe be there for him emotionally but not telling him wont prevent him from finding out and will cause him more upset How did his moms cat die? and how did three dogs die in that house and yours died in a fire a week ago? That seems like an abnormal amount of pets dying suddenly"
"Grandpa spanked my daughter
My (36f) dad (69m), aka grandpa, spanked my three year old daughter and I’m pissed. 

My immediate family and I are all very close. We live down the street from each other and see each other multiple times a week. The cousins play together at grandma and grandpa‘s all the time. Grandpa is my daughter‘s favorite person. He is everyone’s favorite person really, he is wonderful and loving and just a blast to be with.  The truest family man there ever was. But he’s also old school with certain things. 

My daughter is three and the attitude is REAL. We were all at the house the other day and she came running up to me screaming and crying saying “grandpa hit me on my butt!” He came into the room right after and explained that she deliberately disobeyed him by knocking books on the ground after he told her not to. He said that he lightly spanked her and she went berserk. 
I am pissed and literally 48 hours ago told him for like the tenth time that we do not use physical punishment with our kids. But my dad said when he’s with them or they’re under his roof and they’re disobeying then he’s going to handle it his way. My mom, aka grandma, told him he needs to listen to me because I’m her parent and I’m the one who decides how to punish her.  They are my only babysitters and we are all so close so I’m heartbroken over this because it means I can’t leave her alone with him anymore. She is only three!!!! Don’t hit her!!!","This is sign that your father is getting impatient with the kid and you should reduce the time of them babysitting If I were in your shoes, that would not be a person who spends time with my children unsupervised. I agree that the hitting is wrong and there are countless studies supporting that corporal punishment has negative impacts on childhood development/attachment/outcomes. And additionally, that line he said about “when they are with him/in his house he will handle it his way” is a major red flag. If someone can’t agree to align and take my lead on how I want my kids treated then I don’t trust them to be alone together 🤷‍♀️ simple as that."
"How do I keep progressing?
I’m a SAHM of one with another on the way. I love being home and don’t want to work until our kids go to school. Question is though, I feel stuck/stagnant and as if I’m not progressing as a person. I went to school, got a master’s degree, and obtained a certification before my child was born. Now I just feel stuck. I feel like I’ve been working toward something all my life to better myself and now I’m just stuck. Anyone else felt the same way/what’d you do to fix it? I feel like I just need a goal or something but not sure what to do!","You could try cultivating a non professional interest. It could be honing an existing skill like cooking from scratch or gardening. Or something completely new. Reading after my kid is in bed every night makes me feel like I’m always growing and learning something new even if it’s passive.  

Right now I’m learning to mend clothes and linens. I’ve only done small holes and tears so far, but it’s been very rewarding and it’s a practical skill I will be able to pass on to my kid. I felt the same way for many years until I created some new hobbies, made new friends, and challenged myself mentally through books and interesting conversation.  Growth doesn't have to be career only, there are a lot of options out there. Maybe you are doing a deep dive into communication and relationships to improve with your parents, siblings, partner, etc. Perhaps you want to learn to play guitar? Pick anything at all and become an expert!"

"LGBT ships and a tween
So this may not be the right sub for this at all, but here goes:

My 11 year old daughter lives with her mom. I have her every other weekend. For the past year or so she’s been interested in shipping (putting into imaginary relationships) her favorite characters. For instance, Sonic x Shadow or Harry x Draco. Almost all of her ships are not straight.

Her mom is a very conservative Christian. I used to be until my own sexuality blossomed really late. Well, she has banned ships. No videos about them, no talking about them. She’s even banned certain friendships because those other children will talk about sexual orientation in a progressive way (she’s read texts and heard stories).

I personally don’t care. She knows I’m not straight and so I’m trying to provide my own perspective and give her a safe place to explore her own burgeoning feelings (if there are any, that is).

Am I doing wrong by essentially undermining her mom’s rules and wishes? What can I do differently if I should?

Please note when I say conservative Christian, I mean like if my daughter does turn out to be LGBT of any sort, she will be disowned.","I disagree with some of the posters here because her interest in ships and imaginary relationships is developmentally appropriate. Things like fantasy relationships and crushes on celebrities are ways to explore their own maturing feelings with no risks. Of course, every kid is different, not all of them do it and everyone is on their own time table. As much as we don't want our kids to grow up too fast, a lot of girls start puberty around 11 and have a lot of feelings to deal with!


I wouldn't try to push things one way or another. Let her be free to think about ships or whatever safe hobby she's into. Odds are she'll move on to the next interest on her own! Isn't she at the age where she's going to do it anyway? Wouldn't you rather have her have a safe space where she discusses complex emotions with an adult?"
"How do you have any quality time with your kids during the week?
I mean that literally - am I doing something wrong, or is my family's seemingly normal schedule actually not normal?

I feel like there is no time to do anything fun with my children (2, 5, and 7) during the week.  The daily schedule on a typical day is essentially this:

* \~7am kids wake up 
* 7-7:30am - breakfast 
* 7:30-7:40 - clean them up, put on clothes, brush teeth
* 7:45 - off to school (ideally; in practice it's usually more like a mad rush at like 7:55) - my wife typically takes them in the morning
* 7:45-8am - breakfast (for me), then start working (I work from home; my wife is in the office a few days a week)
* Mon/Wed/Fri:  the little one is in preschool and I pick him up at 3pm.  Our nanny picks up the other two at elementary school at 2:30 and I meet them at them at the park.
* Tues/Thurs:  I pick up the older two and bring them to the park to meet our nanny.
* \~5pm - stop working, one of us (or both) get dinner ready
* 5-5:30 - nanny arrives home with the kids - if it's on the earlier side, they want to play, but I can't because I'm making dinner
* 5:30 or 5:45 - dinner 
* 6-something (6:30 on average?) - finish dinner, then I do the dishes and clean while my wife brings them upstairs for baths/brushing teeth/getting ready for bed
* 7 or 7:15 - start putting kids to bed - generally one of us will take the little guy and the other will take the older two.  Read a couple books, maybe play a game with the older ones.  Sometimes a good chunk of this time is just trying to get them to put their pajamas on and/or clean their room.  Goal is to have them in bed by 7:30 (in reality this is usually more like 7:45), so there's about 15 minutes to do something ""fun.""
* By 8pm usually the two younger ones are asleep.  The oldest will then read in bed for another hour on average.

So basically our interaction with the kids on any weekday is:

1. morning:  45 minutes doing whatever is possible to get them fed/clothed/cleaned and to school on time
2. evening:  eating dinner together (5% talking, 95% cleaning spilled drinks/making alternate meals when they refuse to eat what we cooked/trying to get them to actually eat meal #2/etc.), then (for my wife) struggling to get them clean and ready for bed, then about 15 minutes of ""fun"".

Basically we have about 3 hours together, and about 90% of that time is spent trying to get them to do things (all necessary) that they don't want to do.

I feel like my entire relationship with my kids during the week is making them do stuff (and a lot of the time, getting frustrated when they don't do it).  I'd love to be able to sit down with them and play legos or a game or something, but there's just no time.

  
Is this normal?  Is my schedule not as normal as I think it is?  Do people actually enjoy trying to get 3 kids bathed/clothed/fed and consider that to be ""quality time""?  Is there some obvious way to improve the above schedule that I'm not seeing?

What am I doing wrong??","All this sounds average for our modern lives where we have conditioned ourselves to work so much Alright I’m gonna say something that I know won’t be popular but it’s the only thing that worked for us: ease up on the schedule a bit and allow for spontaneity. I would say preemptively decide which times in the schedule are hard caps (cannot be changed at all) and soft caps (there’s some wiggle room) and just allow the moments to come when they do. Especially if your kids are alright sleepers. 

I fell into the exact same thing with schedules and it’s only when my mom stayed a while that I realised this. I remember one time my youngest was having so much fun in the bath but it was time for jammies and bed and I was about to try and figure out how to get her to leave the tub and my mom just asked why, said that there’s time, we can afford another ten or twenty minutes in the bath. In the end what happened that night was we made a game of guessing what jammies she wanted to wear while she was bathing with my mom purposefully choosing ridiculous things (like suggesting she wears her dad’s suit) and then when she seemed to be losing interest we chose the jammies she wanted and she got changed and went to bed. She fell asleep about 45min later than usual and had a longer nap the next day but it’s still one of my most cherished memories."
"Asking for over an hour for my 4 year old to brush his teeth
After asking for over an hour for my 4 year old to brush his teeth, I just lost my shit and screamed at him. Like my throat is hurting I screamed so loud and I had to leave the house the second my husband got home, I’m still shaking. I tried everything before hand… taking away toys, no tv for a week, he can’t do soccer this week, no staying for after school play… is this normal 4 year old behavior? I feel like I always have to ask him multiple times to do things and it usually takes me speaking slightly louder for him to do it, but this is the first time he has just flat out refused like this. I’m sorry if I’m rambling, I’m just losing my patience. He’s so strong willed and stubborn and I’m not sure how to deal with it. Is it just going to get worse as he gets older? I’m feeling like a totally failure, I can’t even get my child to do simple tasks… has anyone else felt like 4 has been the most difficult age?","I also ask first warn second then do it myself even if it means holding them down. 
My son who is almost four will always whine while brushing teeth. 
He is also very strong willed and will laugh most times when he is being naughty. I try not to bargain with him. I ask. Warn. Then timeout or toy gets taken away (whatever is applicable to situation) So I would say you ask once, MAYBE twice, and then you don’t give him a choice—brush his teeth yourself. Otherwise, he thinks he has power to say no, get a reaction out of you, etc.

And there shojld be consequences for not listening, but they need to be immediate. No TV for a week is way too long for a 4 year old, and it doesn’t affect him until tomorrow so he doesn’t care today. Same for no soccer, no staying for school play, even taking toys away if it’s bedtime anyway. I’d say consequences at bedtime are things like no story, no song, etc. 

Another thing you can try is a sticker reward. If you brush your teeth, you get a sticker, but I’m only going to ask once. Otherwise, no sticker and you can try again tomorrow."
"Should I drop my son’s nap?
My son turned 3 a couple of months ago, and I am wondering if I should drop his nap. I always offer a nap to him, and sometimes he sleeps and sometimes he doesn’t. When he does sleep, I never let him sleep longer than 2 hrs. But I’ve noticed that if he does nap, a lot of the time it takes FOREVER for him to fall asleep at bedtime. But when he doesn’t nap, sometimes he will fall asleep kind of early in the evening, which makes me think that he might still need a nap. 

Does anybody have any experience with this? Did you get to the point where you stopped offering your toddler a nap, or did you just let them drop them on their own? Thanks!","I’d cap the nap at an hour if you still want that nap time to get stuff done. But my daughter is almost 3 and stopped napping shortly after turning 2. Sometimes she’ll knock out in the car, never longer than like 20-30 mins I noticed that bedtime was horrendous when she took a nap and the days we had to skip naps, she could hang for the most part and she went to bed earlier, fell asleep quicker and stayed asleep until her normal time the next morning. She was in preschool and took naps so I couldn’t control that but once summer came, we just skipped naps all together and now she’s done! That was after 4 that she dropped naps, but she probably could have done it sooner, again she was in preschool and they have to offer naps"
"I feel guilty for prioritizing my young family..
I am a young mom, married with a 1 year old.

I got my teaching degree a couple years ago, for context where I live once you get your degree you must complete two years of full time hours (interm certificate) to get your full certification. You have a three year window to do this and if not you must reapply for anotjer 3 year window to complete it.

But before I started i decided I would take a little pause before jumping into my career.. Then by the Fall my husband and I decided to have a baby as we were so ready for it.

I knew this would prolong me starting my career, but I thought I would just go back after my baby turned one year old. Fast forward a year later, I can't bare the thought of leaving my baby full time.

I am going to substitute teach so I can work when I want and be home when I want. Being a substitute will help me get my full certificate hours, but it will take a while to complete them this way.

Now here's where I struggle, we are wanting to have another baby sooner rather then later.. I know in my heart I am happy subbing and having another baby, but I feel so incredibly guilty for wanting to grow and focus on my family instead of my career. 

I feel an intense amount of pressure to complete my teaching hours, but this time is so precious with my child and future children.

This situation really hurts my heart and I don't know what to do: (

I'm just looking for thoughts and if anyone has ever felt similar. it's really getting me down.","Where is this guilt coming from? You aren't hurting anyone, and you're making a good choice for you and your family so...? Get the teaching hours later. They’ll wait. Your kids infancy won’t 🤷🏻‍♀️

"We were in a car crash...
On Wednesday me and my 5 year old daughter (soon to be 6) were in a car crash. No fault of mine we got took out by an old man not stopping at a junction, about 35 straight into the passenger side (my daughters side)

We were extremely fortunate, he hit mainly the engine and wheel arch and not my daughters door, we spun and ended up facing the other direction. Luckily my daughter upon impact had brought herself into the Fetal position in her car seat, id lent over and thrown my left arm over her to help pin her in (we were both properly secured in, mum brain just kicked in I guess) it was a right off, by whatever grace of the universe my daughter came away with minimum bruises and very minor scratches, no whiplash or anything.... I suffered quite severe bruising and whiplash but honestly im not even complaining. Extremely lucky, extremely thankful, for the impact it could have been a different story.

My issue:
When we came to a stop I ofcourse shouted and asked if she was okay, she said yes, I said check your body are you okay? She said yes, I immediately called 999 and managed to get us both out of the car (with the help of a local pulling and holding the door), sat us both down on the side of the street while I gave the ambulance details (another woman came for my phone and took over) atleast 5 people at different points and sometimes more than once mentioned to my daughter and me how suprised they were she wasn't crying, how brave she was for not crying, how they would have cried and shes so brave...... I did have my little mentions to her that ""its okay if we need a cry aswell"" and all I got was ""no i dont need to im brave"" i didnt force it..... police and ambulance came..... mentioned how brave she was....... I knew this would come to bite me in the ass, to me I knew it was shock and she hadn't processed.


And it has, it started with constantly telling people she was in an exciting crash and was brave and look at mummies poorlies (bruises etc) then added wanting to see the car pictures and the cctv of the crash, still checking my sores all while her hyperactivity has sky rocketed. My kid has always been a hyper kid, off the walls sort of kid, cannot keep still... but somewhat reasonable and manageable. I have lost all control.

She is so dysregulated, throwing herself from sofa to sofa isn't uncommon but the force shes doing it, constantly being told by everyone to slow down, calm down, take a breath. She use to spam talk calling me when she wanted my attention, we worked on the bluey hand hold and it got better.... now its like shes on speed, probably 7 consecutive ""mummys"" in 2.3 seconds, the minute she has any sort of telling off from someone, she takes herself away and exaggerated crys (she is crying but purposefully making it loud and forceful as opposed to her genuine crys) and if shes been told 2 or 3 times and theyve gotten serious (like her nan) shes then heartbroken, ive stopped her running off and started asking her for a hug so I can try and regulate her, im explaining and defending her to other adults but im honestly just waiting for the mother of all meltdowns.....

I need to help her process this, I need a game plan on how I can help.. we're at the doctors Monday.
Im working on the adults around her aswell... just cos the kid isn't knocked about like i am doesn't mean she wasn't in a damn car crash?!.

Any and all advice honestly, please and thank you 🙏💗

Edit: spelling","Hi! 

So, like you when my daughter was 5 (now 13) we were in a car crash. She had minor injuries, bruises and a scratch but thankfully alive and okay, it was the after that affected us so harshly.

She took like ten steps backwards development wise. She lashed out, hit, yelled, threw tantrums and so on. When we had ours she was calm and collected as well.
Prior she was a calmer kid, somewhat hyperactive but we were teaching her tools along with the end of preschool. 

It took a long time to get her to a better place. I was injured too, that's a lot on a child. 

She was watched over by a  pediatrician and she ended up on a low dose of anxiety meds.
Explained it as basically minor concussive syndrome with trauma effected her ability to tell fight and flight, applying it to every situation and just didn't let up.
Her poor little brain was stuck in the 'about to hit moment'
Look up concussions, your brain is just a meat ball in a small box, if moved about a lot; it moves a lot in your head, and it is not smooth inside I would say this calls for a bit of professional support, maybe trauma or ptsd"
"First words timeline?
My son turned 12 months last week. He “talks” all the time - jumbled syllables that I don’t understand, but he is communicating. He understands me (example, he will clap when I ask, “can you clap?”) and responds to his name most of the time (unless he is deep in playing mode!).

The nurse had me feeling all sensitive. She said by 12 months he should be able to say 3 clear words. When I said he doesn’t, she asked me if I read to him (yes, daily) and if I give him screen time (I do not).

The doc said that all babies develop on their own timeline, but she also asked if I’d like to be referred to a speech pathologist. He’s so little! I don’t want to put this pressure on him at such a young age, but also I wonder if I am missing something? 

Thanks!","A speech path for a 1 year old? Are they kidding?  Honestly I’m shocked by this. That’s something you would think about over 2 years, he is just a baby. My son could say 3 words at 10 months and similar age my daughter was saying 2 word sentences. All babies develop differently physically and cognitively so I definitely wouldn’t be concerned. As an example My son was quite behind in his gross motor skills for awhile which I was worried about but in time he has come through and now I have no concerns about it :) 
The fact he is developing in other ways you mentioned is great I am an SLP, my daughter didn’t say 3 clear words by 1 yr old, as a professional I had no worries (clearly as a parent still a bit worried despite KNOWING that she was fine) now she is 21 months and doing 2 word combos which is a 24 month milestone. It’s okay!!!

"Son wants his own phone?
My son is in 7th grade now and most of his friends have their own phones.

I don't mind him having one, but I have a lot of concerns about it... Predators, inappropriate content, too much screen time, etc...

What are other parents doing about it?","Read The Anxious Generation before you decide

Personally my kids didn't get an actual smartphone until 17. The 13 year old has a Gabb watch and the 16 yr old has a gabb phone Read The Anxious Generation! There is an audiobook and I listened while doing chores which helped me get through it. You can also look up Jonathan Haidt podcasts as well. 

He says to wait until they are 16 to have a phone with social media. If a kid needs a phone before that, make it one that only calls and texts."
"My Daughter Busted My Phone Screen…
It was a complete accident. Her dad FaceTimed her while she was skating and I handed her my phone not even thinking. She fell. She had a bloody shin and a bad strawberry on her thigh. Her first thought “oh no I broke your phone” with tears in her eyes. My first thought “oh no are you ok?!” 

Just a reminder- our littles see us with these devices attached to our hands 24/7. They should never worry about a phone more than their own self. They should never worry that our first concern is our phone when they’re bleeding and bruised. 

I told her my phone screen is replaceable, she is not. And she took a deep breath and we addressed her wounds. I shouldn’t have handed her the phone while she’s skating- my mistake- but it also showed me how much she knows my phone is worth to me and she put it above herself. I need to do better. 

All of that to say as a reminder- put the phone down. Spend time with your kids. It’s their only childhood. And they mean more than any online connection or device. 

❤️","A good reminder. My younger daughter has told me that I'm always on my phone. I pick it up without thinking about it. It's a hard habit to break. My 3 year old brought her dad’s phone back and said “dad, I cleaned the phone for you”. She was rinsing it in the sink and was so proud of herself.  He just smiled back and said Thank You.  We bought him a new phone the next day 😂"
"Advice on school classmate
This is Pennsylvania, for citing jurisdiction.  Student at my child’s school is upset with several students, made a threat list that specifically names students, including my child.  Student who made the list has been expelled.  His note mentioned harming her at home.  Student is 13, likely doesn’t have access to guns or weapons, but does have siblings who drive.  Distance between homes is 15 miles / 25 minutes by car.  

School expulsion and appropriate therapy for student is in place.  

Based on the above, what else is reasonable?  
I am unsure if a PFA is a smart move, or could detonate anger.  Looking for advice, TIA.","Hey /u/SupremoSpider! It looks like you might be new here.

"Birthday party segregation
Hey all. Not sure if this is a weird one or not. My son attended a bday party today and overall it went pretty well (huge win for us for a multitude of reasons that aren't relevant to the post)

One thing I noticed that struck me odd was that the parents seem to segregate themselves off into a men's group and a women's group.  I'm a single dad so I hung with the dads, but I would have thought that everyone would have intermingled a bit? Or is my expectation off?","When I lived in NYC and amongst my own friend group, that isnt a thing, but in the suburbs it is.  I find it really odd. That's how it goes at any get together at my place. In the women's defense we really don't want to hear about how much trouble a crank shaft is causing lol"

Having difficulty in raising my children due to the intrusive nature and disruptive behavior of my adult step daughter.

It is a toxic environment and my children who range from 3 to 14 are growing up in this I hate Dad environment.

"First kiss 3rd grade
My son just told me that he and his “girlfriend” kissed on the lips at school where no one could see them after school. 
He said she initiated it. They’re 8. 
Aside from a conversation about consent, anything else to cover? 
It honestly feels SO young for this to happen? I definitely had “boyfriends” at this age and definitely was not kissing them. I actually don’t recall how old I was for a first kiss.","Not concerning to me, a child therapist I had my first ‘kiss’ on the bus in 4th grade. It was just a little peck. I wouldn’t really overthink it, overreact or get into a conversation that’s too heavy for a 3rd grade ‘relationship’. It’s most likely completely innocent."
"Affection without cuddles? 5-year-old never hugs/kisses
My daughter is 5, and ever since she was a baby she’s never been into hugs or kisses. She would never kiss me goodbye unless I initiate it and honestly, she’s like that with everyone. The only time she’s really in my arms is at night when we sleep.

What’s interesting is that at home she always wants to be near me. She follows me around constantly, won’t really play alone, and always asks for me. We do a lot together: we play, she takes my hand when we walk, and she’ll lie on me when she’s falling asleep. She also has good friends at childcare, she’s very talkative, funny, and otherwise thriving.

Part of me wonders if I should be concerned about her not being physically affectionate in the usual way, or if it’s just her personality. At the same time, I can’t help but feel sad sometimes. I miss the cuddles and hugs I never really got, and it hits harder when I see other kids running into their parents’ arms or smothering them with kisses.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it something I should worry about, or is it just her way of showing love?","I can tell you that this is perfectly fine. Don't try to force her to be more physically affectionate. 

Fun fact: For a lot of autistic people (myself somewhat included), we aren't often physically affectionate. We tend to demonstrate our affection in other ways, like trying to get thoughtful gifts or just sitting beside you and doing something-parallel play. /u/heyjude2929, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"help / advice (I’m desperate)
I (29F) have two children (2.5F) and (8moM). My daughter has always been independent and strong-willed, curious and energetic, and I love those things about her. However, the flip side to those qualities is that she is absolutely pig-headed, does whatever she wants, and at the moment, consequences/discipline seems to have 0 effect. 

We try timeouts, taking toys away, bargaining. Regretfully, I find myself more often losing my temper almost straight away and shouting. That isn’t the kind of parent I want to be, and I’m trying really hard to change that, and I know that is my issue not hers. 

I think I mostly need reassurance that everyone’s toddlers are like this and she will just grow out of this phase. Every day feels like wading through water and I’m just waiting to put the kids to bed so I can snatch a couple of hours alone before sleeping and the whole thing starts again. 

What are the best ways for me to begin dealing with my daughter’s behaviour? I feel completely clueless and embarrassed but I’m so worried that I’m going to do something wrong and it’s going to affect her later down the line.","Hey /u/rhianik! It looks like you might be new here.

"Sleeping in Snuggle Me
I have an almost 4 week old who does not sleep great in the crib/bassinet for naps. He does ok at night. We attempt to lay him down 1-2 naps a day with mixed results. We have been baby wearing for afternoon naps but after my son’s circumcision they said no baby wearing for 2 weeks…

Sometimes I lay him in the snuggle me when he’s fallen asleep and I’m in the room with him. He sleeps great in it… I try to make sure his head is flat (chin not tucked to chest). I KNOW the website says not to sleep in it, but if I’m watching him and he often has a pacifier in his mouth I really feel like he’s fine. Anyone else do this?? Am I a terrible parent? The alternative seems like either no sleep or I have to hold him for every nap which is just not realistic when it’s just me at home all day.

I’ve seen other posts of people saying they let babies sleep in rockers or bouncers which honestly feels worse (no judgement!) because baby’s spine is curved.","Obviously controversial, but I did this with both of my babies, and most of the moms I know did the same.

"Should I be concerned about adult son not sharing with me?
I have a son turning 30 and although I feel like we have a good relationship there are parts of his life that are a total blank to me. 

He shares about his health issues, his work problems, his roommate conflicts, his housekeeping issues,  his uncertainty about career etc. 

But he has never shared any information with me about personal romantic relationships. In fact I have no idea if he has had any serious relationships. I just shrugged it off as him being private and he will share he thinks it's important to share until my sister said that she thought it was weird that he never talked to me about this stuff. Her exact reaction was ""But why would he never talk to you about this stuff?"" 

And I have no clue. I never put any pressure on my adult kids to get married or have kids in the traditional sense. I also never pressured them about dating and they also both know that should either of them not be straight that it's also perfectly fine with me. That I love them for who they are. 

I have an adult daughter who is 34 and she is open with me. She is single but she talks about relationship issues she's having and asks for advice. My son on the other hand does not. Not even with his father. 

I should note that my husband and I separated in 2023 and prior to that we had marital issues for about a decade or more. And when I told my son we were separating his feedback was that he wasn't surprised. So now I'm feeling like us not having a good relationship has had some affect on him; I don't know. 

I wasn't worried about this and now I wonder... should I be?","This seems really normal to me, I don’t really talk to my mom about that stuff either, I’m 32 and consider us to be very close. I just don’t feel the need to tell her everything about my life. Her and my dad have been happily married for 47 years, like dance in the kitchen happily married. Two thoughts:


1. The fact that he talks to you about so many things? That's amazing! And really rare. You obviously have a very good relationship. 


2. He might be asexual, or just not that experienced yet and ashamed of it (or even somewhere in the LGBTQ+ space and not yet comfortable with coming out). It doesn't matter what it is, just respect his choice.


You really have nothing to worry about."
"Distance parenting, extremely depressed after summer
I am a long-distance parent to a wonderful, lovable, compassionate child, and I go through such a depressive episode every time I have to bring them back to their other parent after the summer.

I live in a different continent than the other parent, and my child has a sibling there. My child is eight years old. They go to school there, so I can pretty much have them only for the summer. Paying for their travel overseas is expensive, so I’ve limited their visits to me to only the summer months when school is off. 

I go and visit them during the school year. Last year I was there for a month around November-December and in 2024 I went there in March for a month or so. 

We have a pretty good time together when they’re visiting me for the summer: we go see all the relatives, go to amusement parks, go on hikes and camping, visit museums and so on. my child speaks English only and I speak my native language and English. I know the language barrier frustrates them a little. They also feel a bit lonely(understandable) when they’re here. 

Every August I go through very deep stages of grief and I can’t pretty much function. I can’t see a picture of them without crying, I can’t focus on work or studies and I usually need to be reminded multiple times of approaching deadlines, which I usually miss. I’m underperforming on all stages of life for about a month to month-and-a-half after they’re gone. And it feels like they’re gone, like passed away, even though I rationally know they’re not. I lose sleep.

Can the other distance parents give me advice on how to deal with this? I don’t know if what I’m going through is normal or not. Is there support groups for parents like me?

"I want to be excited my kid is starting school next week, but the news has ruined that
Now I feel like a bad person because I look forward to My Kid going somewhere where someone might just run in and take his life from the world. It’s so unfair.

I should get to be excited. I should be thinking how nice the silence will be, how much more productive I’ll be when I’m not sensoried out all the freaking time…and as soon as I start thinking about that, I think about the parents who lost everything because of some selfish asshole.

Parenting in the US is a constant punishment. I have no real family so support has been very limited, my family lost our business to covid (RIGHT when we had our baby), so we’ve been financially drowning and running on fumes for almost 6 years now.

I’m just mad that it seems like this country makes sure parents never get to feel relief.

My son is about to start kindergarten. He’s so excited. I just wish I felt like I could be, too, without feeling like I’m just throwing caution to the wind.","My 13-year-old got upset that I let her little sister, who is in pre-K, get light up shoes. She told me that if there’s a shooter, the light up shoes might give away her little sister’s location. This shouldn’t be our reality. We need sensible gun control. I understand. This is my daughters’ first week of school. They love school and I love their school. I have confidence in the schools safety measures, but it’s still hard. I want to be positive for my kids. I don’t want to stifle their love and excitement for school, but it’s scary and depressing."
"Please give me a crystal ball
I have two little girls ages 3 and 4. They are fifteen months apart. Like all parents say, I love them so so much….blah blah; HOWEVER, they are horrible right now. This past summer was the worst summer of my life. They are both very emotional, lots of tantrums, and so. Much. Defiance. Especially from the older one. Every time
I describe my eldest’s behavior people always state, “Wow! She is really strong willed!”  I feel so isolated because everyone else’s parenting stories are like, “Oh I love this age!” “My child is a perfect angel”. My stories are “My child calls me stupid and kicks and bites me for making her breakfast the way she wanted.” Since this is anonymous I feel comfortable revealing that I am starting to hate her. I am in an abusive relationship with my children that I not only have to tolerate but I also cannot retaliate. I do all of the things a parent is supposed to be doing: no spanking, time out appropriate to their ages, stick with routines, make sure to always check if they are hungry/tired/hot/overstimulated, use positive reinforcement, meaning when they do something good/kind, ALWAYS show them love and affection, being present (like not on my phone when they are around). I am not really looking for advice. I just want to hear from the parents that have been in my position that are now a few years down the line.

"My child is struggling at school
It’s only been a few weeks into the new school year but my child begged to stay home for school. I let them for one day but I’m trying to figure out a longer solution. A little bit of back story, we just moved to SC from NM so a whole new school system. They were getting extra help a their last school(side classes) I’ve also learned that this is their teachers first year at this school. With that being said they have told me that the teacher yells quite a bit at the whole class he used to teacher 4th grade but now teachers 2nd. They say he talks too fast and moves through lessons quickly. He yells so loud that they want to cry. I know my child may be more sensitive than others but never have they ever said anything like this before. He’s not yelling at my child directly although I’m not sure. We were already looking into after school tutoring (we moved here just this month), i haven’t talked to the school yet but any advice on what questions to ask the school? I plan on going to next week. How disruptive would changing school be? Normally they don’t struggle with understanding math but the stress of what’s going on in class is making homework difficult. I knew they would need extra help coming to a new state but I didn’t think the teacher would be making that more challenging. I can get her after school help but if they don’t want to go to class something because of the teacher. Idk what to do. They say he’s not mean all the time they just feel like he’s treating them like 4th graders. Which I don’t understand how a someone can go into working with children and not work on having patience and understanding how to handle children. Would appreciate advice on what kinda help, helped other parents transition their child from another state school systems. I don’t want them to fall behind. I haven’t gotten any feedback yet, how long do I wait before going to the principal? I understand the teacher may be overwhelmed but what do I do if the teacher is unhelpful? Who do you go to test for learning disabilities? 

I have messaged (Wednesday, 3 days ago) the teacher but have yet to get a reply. This wasn’t the first message we moved in a few days before school started so we missed meeting the teacher before hand I emailed him to get anything we missed like school pick up info class schedule and expectations etc. I didn’t get any of that for a week. the first few days the school would not let me pick up my child from the pick up line without a car tag which they told me the teacher would give me one. he did not even after asking and yes I have his correct email. I had to go into the office to get it settled. When I did get the stuff I need especially the app the teacher uses to talk to parents. I’ve downloaded the app and sent one messages but have yet to receive a reply.","I would go ahead and set up a parent-teacher conference so that you can hear what the teacher has to say. It's not uncommon for kids to be at different levels when they have to transfer schools. I think you can let him know that they're having trouble keeping up so he can make adjustments with them or get them the help that they need. If there's not satisfactory progress after that, then you can go to the principal. this sounds a little too vague to me to have an idea of what’s going on. it’s the beginning of the school year so maybe these 2nd graders are getting rowdy and loud, and he’s raising his volume because the overall volume is loud and he’s trying to get them to quiet down?

i’d shoot the teacher a message and try to get a better understanding of what’s going on, and if you’re not satisfied, go to the admin and ask if someone could check in on your son. i think as long as you’re framing it that your child is having a hard time with the adjustment and you’re wanting to make sure he has a successful year instead of accusatory towards the teacher, you’ll get more cooperation."
"There’s downsides to comfort toys apparently!
My daughter (almost 3y) has never been interested in having a “comfort toy” for bed time, however recently she’s had a couple of real night terrors so I thought it might help.

The teddy just sits in her bed somewhat near her with no interest shown, until the moment she gets up in the morning and it gets a big hug before she’ll put it back on its shelf.

I chalked it up to her not needing it/caring for it.

Then this morning she decided to scoop all the poo out her nappy and play with it (literally the first ever time she has done that wtf). Teddy was absolutely covered (as was *literally* everything else) so was washed and put on the radiator to dry, didn’t see the big deal since she never went near it at night anyway.

Well, her dad and I are watching tv downstairs with the monitor on and see her suddenly leap out her bed in the pitch black, run at teddy’s shelf in a blind panic, and begin frantically flailing her arms over it trying to find teddy.

My partner ran upstairs grabbing the bear on his way, meanwhile I watched her begin to run in circles trying to find this bear in her completely dark room as she began to hysterically sob for it.

She’s back asleep now, bear has been returned to her bed. She didn’t even want it while crying?! Then when she fell asleep her dad laid the teddy in her arms and she immediately rolled away from it.

Absolutely baffling","As so many of us have learned always have two lovies. 

I think it’s worth noticing that your daughter’s interaction with her comfort toy didn’t match your expectations but it sounds like she has actually always been interested in her comfort toy. It’s just provided comfort by being near her/watching over her etc without her needing to cuddle it or carry it around. That info might come in handy in the future  when she turns into a teen who maybe just needs you to sit with her and be present etc."
"My 8 year old is pooping her pants non stop..
Hi everyone,

Reposting because my original post was removed. We’re already under a doctor’s care and following their guidance, so I’m just looking for advice and support from parents who’ve been in similar situations.

My daughter is 8 and has been dealing with bowel accidents for a few years now. Some days are fine, but other days she can have multiple accidents, sometimes 3–5 in a day. These last few months have been especially tough, and with school starting, I’m trying to find the best way to support her so she can feel confident and less stressed. She is taking prescribed Miralax when it gets really bad. 

She’s also okay with the idea of wearing protection, and she’s taken and used  her younger sister’s pull-ups a few times without asking. At school, I think pull-ups make sense cause i cant imagine the torment and anxiety if she has a leaky accident. They’re discreet and will help her focus on her day instead of worrying about an accident. But is it the right move? Is this a normal thing to do to your child with this issue? 😞

At home, though, I really don’t feel pull-ups are the answer. If she wears them, she may not seem motivated to try the toilet schedule. But maybe im wrong...
But Because of that, I’ve chosen not to allow pull-ups at home. Instead, and because of the sheer amount of accidents and grossness I’m leaning toward diapers when protection is needed. They’re much better for containing the mess, they keep her clothes from being ruined, and importantly; she provably wouldnt really want to wear them. That discomfort, I think, could help encourage her to keep trying with the toilet without making her feel shamed or punished.
She will always have the choice to wear underwear... I won't force her. But my laundry room floor is a mess with poopy underwear and it's getting worse.

She’s been in therapy for over a year, and I’ve worked hard on supporting her.. we’ve tried scheduled bathroom times, adjusted her dairy-free diet, added fiber, and kept her meals balanced. Despite all of that, the accidents are still happening. She often tells me she doesn’t even feel the urge until it’s too late, which makes me want to find a balance between keeping her comfortable and still encouraging progress.

Has anyone else managed this balance; allowing pull-ups at school for confidence and discretion, but using diapers at home so that the situation is easier to manage and doesn’t reduce her motivation to use the potty? Did that approach help in the long run?

This is never about punishment. I love my daughter so much, and all I want is for her to feel safe and supported while we figure this out together.

Please Do NOT reply with medical advice or tell me to see a doctor. I am on it!! Please reply with your non medical recommendations and advice please so that this post isn't removed. 

I'm sure I'm not alone 
Thanks!","By therapy, I'm assuming you mean occupational or incontinence therapy. Also, your daughter probably isn't feeling the need to poop. When it gets to this point their colon is stretched and the nerves don't really work.

She might still be constipated even with the miralax and the accidents are just what's getting around the blockage. 

We had to work with my 6 yo and pee accidents, the pull-ups became a crutch. He wouldn't even try to go to the bathroom if he was wearing one. Even the threat of having to go back to diapers didn't deter him. I did have him do all the laundry associated with his accidents, that helped a little because he realized how much work it was to interrupt his day to do it. Our son has encopresis. He had accidents for years, but has stopped now for over a year. For us, it was MiraLAX daily, toileting routine, counseling, and positive reinforcement. When they get too backed up, they literally can’t feel it coming out. It took quite sometime before he got that feeling back. We didn’t use pull-ups. Lots of cleaning of underwear. The school had a toilet routine for him and he had extra clothes there. He was allowed to use the nurse’s office restroom. He actually didn’t have very many accidents during school hours. He usually held it the best he could all day, and then would have an accident when he got home. So we had to adjust our schedule to ensure we tried to catch that. We also explained at length what happens inside our body when we hold our poop inside. Good luck. It was a long road to get through it."
"How to stop toddler biting frenzys
Help! My 2 yr 3mo old toddler will go into a ""frenzy"" and start biting and hitting and scratching and basically all the bad things they shouldn't do. They think it's hilarious even during negative consequences. He does it sometimes during the day with no trigger but I would like to especially address the night time which is triggered merely by the arrival of bedtime. 


At bedtime he gets so riled up. I keep thinking he's overtired but even when I try a super early bedtime it's like he knows oh it's bed time time to lose my f-ing mind. My daughter did the same thing at bedtime at that age so I'm wondering what is the deal with my parenting that my kids do this. I also thought maybe he needs more sensory input so I let him do summersaults and run around to try to ""get his energy out"" but that hasn't seemed to work so far? We have a calm down routine with a bath, books and calm music every night. Lots of attention and love and soft voices etc. But it's the dark room and the bed that unlocks the frenzy. 

During the ""frenzy"" once it starts there is nothing I can say or do that seems to work. Redirection (telling om that we kiss instead, or let's try gentle, let's play the hug game instead). I often end up walking out with very firm communication about hurting others and he screams and begs for me with what little words he knows while I hold the door closed. Like a reverse timeout but it feels awful like I'm teaching some abandonment or something. Like I won't come even if he's begging me?

During the day we do a time out instantly for biting or hurting behavior. 

I don't have a place I can really leave him safely otherwise and honestly timeout is it's own struggle I feel like it destracts too much from the behavior and becomes it's own power struggle. 

What are parents doing? Am I the only one with kids that do this? I feel so lost with this.","Hey /u/Limp_Acanthisitta1! It looks like you might be new here.

"How to help my child with being in a class with a disruptive annoying kid
My daughter, Alex, goes to a small school. There’s another child, Leah, who’s a year older who was in her split class last year and is going to be in her class again this year (3/4). There is no “ask to change class” options. 

Alex has some struggles. They have ADHD (medicated), can talk a little too much, and has some sensory sensitivities. She’s a rule follower without always understanding that social rules aren’t the same as school rules. She’s made a couple of good friends and we have her working with an OT. 

Leah has some struggles. She is indulged at home and has unmedicated ADHD, so she’s impulsive, rude, and bossy. She sometimes physically manhandles kids when she wants them to do something with her, has meltdowns, and is rude to her teachers. 

They can get along outside of school (both were on the same sport team) but in the class it is rough. Alex wants to be left alone or to be with her friends, and Leah wants to be friends. They’ve tried including Leah but she will try to boss the kids around at outside breaks. 

Last year we had to talk about how excluding Leah wasn’t kind but also that it’s okay to tell her she can’t be in charge. 

Alex had a hard time managing Leah’s behaviour. She knows she isn’t supposed to be rude but doesn’t want to be Leah’s friend. She’ll get paired with Leah because other kids are mean to Leah and she’s not. Leah is okay some days but other days tries to boss her around or says mean things. 

She spends a lot of energy each day having to navigate being kind with not wanting to be around Leah. 

We have spent SO MUCH TIME trying to help Alex continue to be kind but also hold boundaries. It was an almost every day discussion and makes school miserable. It’s exhausting and we were hoping for a break. 

Unless Leah moves this is a long term issue. 

What can we do to help Alex have positive days that aren’t focused on Leah? 

Edit: I’m appreciative of all of your advice. For those wondering how I know the circumstances of Leah, we live in a small area, they’ve played on the same sports team for a couple of years (again, no ability to change unless I keep my kid out of that sport) and I’m relatively friendly so I talk to their parents.","I think it is reasonable to discuss your concerns with the teacher. Just because your kid isn’t mean to Leah doesn’t mean it should be her job to manage Leah, that is the teacher’s job. Your kid isn’t a trained and paid para or teacher’s aide, this isn’t her job or responsibility. Teaching your kid to be kind and empathetic is wonderful, but it can’t be an every day requirement for her to be the one paired with and having to deal with this other kid’s issues, doing so is putting your kid’s education and social development at risk. I don't know how mature Alex is, but I wonder if Alex could pull off grey rock. It sounds like Leah is seeking attention so if Alex can pull off a polite grey rock Leah may move on. 


Like respond to Leah without emotion or engagement, but still enough response to be considered polite. Monotone responses. No engagement beyond absolutely necessary 


As many one word responses as possible etc"
"Men who divorced and have kids ?
I’ve been in this situation for a year now—thank God. I see my son (he’s two and a half) once a week for just one hour. I travel two hours every week to see him because my ex-wife lives in another city and we don’t communicate. I meet him with his grandfather.

If anyone is in a similar situation—or in the same city—are you able to see your kids every week? What activities do you do with them, and what gifts do you bring? Especially if you usually meet at a club or a café.","Do you want to see your kid more? Why is it currently so lopsided?

Personally I wouldn't bring a small kid a gift every week or else they will associate you primarily with getting new toys. Also, the custodial parent will have to deal with the toys. He’s 2.5"
"I have concerns about a specific YouTube channel, that my 9yo daughter watch.
Hi. My daughter got her first phone when she had her 9 years birthday, a few months ago. 

One of the rules we have with her and her big brother, is that YouTube time is limited and another rule is that we, the parents, get to see what they are doing on these phone. 

My daughter has 30 minutes of YouTube daily, and one of the channels she watches have giving me concerns. I have tried telling her to stop watching that channel but she throws a big fit when I try. 

It came to my attention when she laughed and told me that it was a mom and daughter, and the daughter was born in 2011 and the mom in 1997. That rubbed me the wrong way, and she proceeded to tell me that the father was in his 40’s. That’s when I bat an eye at her and trying to hide my absolute shock while trying to explain to her, that that’s not a good thing to watch. Furthermore, the content they make a sh!t. 
 
How do I get her to stop watching this channel, and am I the only one seeing a problem here? 

Disclaimer: I live in a Scandinavian country, we have laws on forced marriages and it’s is a big no no in our society. English is not my native language. 

Update: 

Thank you all for the advice. I will definitely be blocking some channels on my daughters YouTube, and look more into this specific channel. For anyone interested it’s Yana Chirkina (apparently they are from Russia, which is a whole other reason to block it) also it seem like the person in their videos that poses as the mother is not, according to another YouTube video, the real mother is 37.",We actively block channels when the content is something we do not want our kid to see. It doesn’t really sound like you’re in charge. Why does your 9-year-old need a smartphone?
"Rumors that my child’s elementary teacher is biased…
In the neighborhood, the parents involved and in the local PTA tell unfortunately negative stories of experiences with a certain elementary teacher. This teacher’s set examples of brief and short communication to the other parents with past experiences, blatantly playing favorites, and possibly discriminating about students she interacts with or sets up for failure. 

In this particular case of word-of-mouth, what thoughts or possibilities may there be? What does a parent do with such a precaution from other trustable parents, but without proof? Do they call the school district administration and demand a change? Does the parent let it play out until issues may arise- and what about having a particularly sensitive child who may not speak up about issues arising? 

Overall, how do I comfort my child..that this may be a unique personal experience to the start of the rumor, and it may not be their experience, but that they may have a different experience entirely? It doesn’t feel like I’m doing enough to settle any worries.","Ah yes because disgruntled parents are a reliable source. Without proof means its literally just accusations.


Id make sure my kid followed the rules and id avoid doing anything as a parent to make sure my kid isnt a target. I.e. gossip with other disgruntled parents and cause baseless rumors to spread I would say just observe carefully. It is possible that those parents are just disgruntled and this teacher is actually just doing her job properly (which would include holding bullies accountable and grading fairly), but it is also equally possible that the parents are actually right and she's a rotten apple that hasn't been dealt with. If you see evidence to the latter, then you become a titanic pain in the school's ass. If it's the former, then just refuse to engage with the baselessness."
"3-year-old suddenly scared of classmate, refusing school need advice
Hi Everyone,

I’m really stressed as a parent and looking for some advice from others. My son just turned 3 and started pre-KG. His class teacher told us recently that he seems scared of another boy in class. She mentioned that the other child doesn’t have much sitting tolerance but is otherwise good at studies. She asked us to tell our son to “stay strong.” I actually appreciate that the teacher at least told us something, because until then my son never said anything at home.

But in the past week, things have changed. He has started bedwetting (which had stopped before), and we saw a red mark on his face. Last night, before going to bed, he cried and told us he doesn’t want to go to school anymore because he is scared of this boy. He even asked us to sit with him inside the classroom. He repeated this several times and was very upset before finally sleeping.

We can clearly see he is under stress at such a young age, and it’s very painful for us as parents.

We plan to talk directly with his teacher on Monday, but I wanted to ask:

How do we raise this with the teacher so that it’s taken seriously?

Is this something common at this age, or should we consider changing school?

How do I support my 3-year-old emotionally when he’s scared of a classmate?

Have other parents faced this? What helped your child?

Any advice would mean a lot.",[removed] This seems extremely extremely unusual to me and I would not be sending my kid Back to that classroom. I would request to watch part of the day to see what’s going on. But ultimately I would ask to be moved to a different classroom or look for another school.
"Hardly anyone showed up to sons birthday party
I’ll start off by saying I’m fairly new to the city I’m currently living in, but over the past year I joined a mommy and me group where I met up other moms frequently. I have always felt we were on good terms, and usually when I’d invite them to hang out they would. A lot of the moms wouldn’t go out of their way to invite me or reach out to me, but I brushed it off as people being busy. 

The majority of the people I invited to my toddler’s party were from this group and I received RSVP’s for 19 kids but only 3 showed up (the ones who came were family). About 45 mins in, I texted the parents who had RSVP’d yes to see if they were still coming and no one answered. I thought I must have messed up the invitation time or something. 

After the party I saw Instagram stories of some of the people I invited hanging out together so texted one of the moms and she was just like “oh sorry we ended up getting busy and forgetting to come.” I called her crying and asked if I did something to upset everyone, and she told me I did nothing wrong but she said something like “honestly I don’t think these girls will ever feel as close to you as you feel to them so I wouldn’t hold the expectation you’ll ever be close friends.” Which made zero sense to me. 

I’ve been so heartbroken. I know my son is still too young to feel rejection from something like this, but it breaks my heart to know that the “village” I thought I had actually doesn’t care about us. I personally cannot ever imagine just not showing up to something I RSVP’D yes for. Like they should have at least texted me to say they weren’t coming. I  made sure to buy enough food, party favors, cake, etc. It was also humiliating that I had to tell my family “I know all these people said they’d come but plot twist they’re all ghosting me.” 

I’m tempted to send a group text going off on the girls and never showing up to another mom group meet up again. Part of me feels like it would just be better to just not say anything, not reach out again and unfollow. What would you do in my situation?","I’d block, unfollow, and not say shit. They couldn’t be bothered to just say no to the invite or even a heads up that they aren’t coming, shit they couldn’t even make an effort to like make up a lie at least. They straight up no showed. I’m really sorry. I had a crappy interaction with a group of moms yesterday at the playground, so maybe I’m extra sensitive. Hugs 🫂 I'd find better friends. I know it's rough moving to a new place and making connections, but this isn't behavior you want to keep putting up with just to have a social circle. Sounds like high school BS to me. 

Do you have any hobbies/activities/etc you could meet people through? It might be nice to have some folks you can connect with over something besides being a parent."
"I get to really sleep in tomorrow. For the first time in years
Maybe this is a rant. I don't know. I've had quite some wine for the first time in a long time because I went out to dinner and drinks with friends. I'm a 100% solo mom to a 5 year old and my son is staying with my parents and tomorrow is a school day. I don't have work tomorrow and I don't have to pick up my son early from my parents because he's going to school. This has not been the situation in literal years.

"Toddler showing interest- how soon should I jump on it
Months ago I started trying to introduce the potty to my son who was 2.5 at the time , he showed little to no interest. I didn’t push it, would just ask if he wanted to use the potty if I noticed him pooping in his diaper. 
I have 3 different potties in the house, one with stairs to the toilet, one flat one that goes over the toilet, and one standalone potty that looks like a toilet. We decided to put it in the living room and it’s kind of just been sitting unused for weeks. This morning while I was getting ready for work , my toddler came to me, diaper off and I seen he had peed in the potty. I told him great job and said he can let me know next time he wants to use his potty. This evening I walked into the living room to him diaper off, and piling toys into his potty. I asked him why he’s putting toys in his potty and he said it’s a mess. Well he had peed& pooped in the potty and was trying to cover it up with his toys. Again I told him good job going on the potty and told him mommy or daddy will come help him after he uses the potty. 
Considering tomorrow is a rainy Saturday and we’ll be home all day I’m wondering if I should start the morning off with trying underwear and seeing how it goes? I don’t want to put too much pressure on him and make him step back from it

"3yo is either extremely defiant or extremely compliant depending on the person
Son is 3.5 yo. I see lots of posts about “threenagers” and defiant behavior. I think we are dipping our toes in that era. I am prepared for defiance, and I know how to stand strong with important boundaries. I know how to deal with my son when he backtalks me, but I don’t know how to react when he yells and sasses my sister who lives with us. It hurts because she loves him so much and is just trying to be helpful when he is being difficult but he rages at her. Any advice about how to respond to him yelling at her would be so helpful.

The other side of the coin is he switches like a lightbulb and is suddenly SO compliant with me. He desperately wants my attention and affection, baby talks, brings me things from all over the house as “presents,” wants to literally stand on my feet and hug my legs. This happens especially when I am trying to get certain tasks done like make his food, clean up, put his laundry away. Everything he does is “mama look,” EVERYTHING. And he even cleans up after himself, shows me how he is trying not to make a mess, and apologizes about 100 times a day. THIS I am not prepared for. Yes I have asked him things over the years like not to make a mess or clean up sometimes or apologize when someone is hurt but my big worry is I have somehow guilted him into feeling small.

"My almost one year old is biting
My daughter will be one next week and she’s already started biting when she gets mad. If I’m holding her, she’ll bite down onto my shoulder or arm, wherever she can. Her daycare has never mentioned it so I don’t think she does it there but I don’t want it to become an issue. I sternly say “no” when she does it or is trying to do it then she just starts crying instead. Anyone had luck with stopping this behavior? Thanks!","Stern anything never worked well with my kids. When they get older they just laugh instead of crying. 
Start noticing the subtle cues that she's about to bite. And then remind her, matter of factly, not with drama, that biting hurts. Or move her a bit away from you at the early signs. If she does bite you, put her down and tell her biting hurts. She will eventually outgrow it My almost 4 year old still bites his younger brother (hard) from time to time. It is a struggle"
"Checking your teenager's phone
Hello, mom to a 16 year old boy here. 
I'm wondering what everyone's take on checking your teenagers phone, how often and until what age? 

I've gotten my son his first phone and I don't know if 16 is to old to be checking/going through his cell phone. Every child is different, but I want to make sure he's not making any bad choices or decisions but I dont want to feel like I need to snoop as well. 

Looking forward to seeing other people's perspectives on this","I never did it, but every kid is different. Based on my knowledge of his whereabouts and activities and friends and behavior and how obnoxiously forthcoming he is, I can trust him. 

I also want him to be able to talk shit about me when he’s mad without me seeing it, honestly. He should be able to talk openly with his peers without me knowing every conversation. 

That said, I had some parenting controls set up to where I knew what apps he has, what websites he visits, and how much time he spends on the phone. I don’t check. 

Unless behavior is odd or something occurs to where I feel hey maybe I should look. 

Between both my children I’ve done that maybe a handful of times in all the years they’ve had phones. 

Just warn him about all the dangers. Especially when it comes to sexting. Aside from obviously never knowing where a photo may end up. Teens can be charged w possession of CSAM even if it’s their own photos."
"I’ve failed as a mum.
This is long and I thought I would add in a few details to help the context (not making excuses)

My sister died when she was 7 and I was 5. My mum turned to alcohol as a way to cope. I was severely beaten (as in hair ripped out and punched etc) and neglected. 

I’ve been in 2 violent and abusive relationships. My older 2 sons from the 1st and my youngest special needs son from the second. 

I believe these have contributed to me failing being a good mum. I’m hoping it’s not too late to fix this. 

Okay so I’ve never yelled or got angry at my kids as I never wanted to be like my mum. Due to the DV the boys witnessed I guess I overcompensated. I found a way to get them whatever they wanted. Christmas and Birthdays extra special etc.

Now my eldest has started high school right at the time we escaped and fled to a safe house and I’m going to assume puberty has began…..

My son has turned really mean. He is like a complete different person compared to the first 12 years. He torments his younger brothers and thinks it’s funny. He treats me horribly. For the first time ever, I’ve yelled 😔

He is refusing counselling and just instantly snaps. He is turning 13 and is already a lot taller than me and I’m starting to think that one day he could even become physical with his brothers or me. It feels like the early stages of becoming out of control.

I’ve stuffed up. It’s like I was so focused on being different from my mum but never focused on healing from a traumatic childhood and then all the violence.

How can I fix this? How can I help him feel better? Has anyone gone through similar and their kids have eventually calmed down?

My heart is breaking","Well, yeah, people that come from a history such as yours parent from trauma. They may do the opposite of what happened to them, but it is still not healthy parenting. However, it isn't you who ""failed"", it's life, and your own parents that failed you. Instagram and Reddit and social media in general are full of positive cr@p that talk about ""breaking the abuse cycle"" as if it was as easy as choosing a new haircut, but you can't break that kind of cycle by yourself! You don't have the instruments to do that because you have been in it since you were a child. Cut yourself some slack: it is not your fault, your intentions were 100% from a place of love, and therefore, the failure isn't yours. All you can do is work from here. But you need professional help, especially with a 13yo. Firstly, I’m sorry you’ve been dealt a shitty hand. I can tell you are trying and that you love your kids. 

The first step is to accept that there is a problem. Which you have. You are a good mom for doing the best you could with the knowledge you had. You left the bad situation, you should be proud of yourself. As it has already been said, therapy for you and them is the BEST and necessary. 

Also want to highlight that from one mom to another, you are the parent. I know you are tired, overstimulated and are in need of a huge break and probably just a hug. Please recognize that your body is also probably in fight mode, and it has been your entire life. So please give yourself some grace. You are all these boys have and if you need to get mad and authoritative to make sure these kids get the best care and treatment you’re going to have to give your boy some tough love. Set boundaries, and please stick to them. I yell all the time, we are human. I am just loud in general, if I ever take it “too far” for my standards, the most important thing is to repair by acknowledgement and apologies. 

Their dads have failed YOU and them. They didn’t choose to be the role model that they deserve and needed and the partner and safe place/ security you deserved. Thank you for respecting yourself enough to leave. 

All 13 year olds are gifted at being mean lol. This is when he needs you most. Please find community where you are and seek help. Please make sure he’s not hanging out with shit kids. Sports, kickboxing, mma whatever your local Y has to offer at risk youth. Karate is another good one as it teaches respect and life skills. What are his interests? Lean into them. He loves you, he’s hurting and he has no skills of emotional intelligence. 

Everything starts with you momma. You get yourself help and support, the boys will be okay. It’s your first time living too. Please don’t be hard on yourself. You’ve already kicked some serious ass in this life. Let yourself find a soft place to land, and remember you are important too. Sending love!"
"FIL is way too attached to my 1 year old
I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, but I need some perspective.

My FIL and MIL live nearby and come over every single day. On one hand, I know we’re lucky to have family who love our son. But it’s getting to the point where I feel smothered.

My son just turned one, and my FIL insists on holding him all the time. If the baby fusses, he swoops in and takes him. If we’re playing on the floor, he’ll pick him up. It feels like he can’t just let my son be unless he’s in his arms.

The part that really bothers me is that I work full time, so I already don’t get as much time with my son as I’d like. When I finally have those precious hours, my FIL is right there, monopolizing him. Sometimes I feel like I’m competing with my own FIL for time with my child.

He also makes comments that really undermine me. For example, my son was in his high chair the other day, just moving around a bit (I was sitting right next to him the entire time), and my FIL said, “Give him to me otherwise he will fall off the chair.” Like… what? He was completely safe, strapped in, and I was literally right there. It made me feel like he doesn’t trust me to even watch my own baby.

It’s starting to feel really overbearing and a little disrespectful of my role as his mum. I don’t want to cause family drama, but I also don’t want to keep silently resenting the situation.

Has anyone else dealt with an in-law who is too attached? How did you set boundaries without it blowing up?

Edit: I spoke to my husband in a very non confronting way. He tried to explain that he’s feeling attached because my FIL is going through something (which I’m aware of) and our son is basically his ‘emotional support’ which made me uncomfortable and frankly angry. I explained to him that he just turned one and he’s already someone’s emotional support? That’s not his responsibility. He’s just a baby.",Where is dad when all of this is going on? Is he aware of the problem? Get him on board and then tell parents that you need to set a schedule for visits. Perfectly reasonable considering that you work. Limit the visits to after meals. And when you may need help or want a break. In laws should not be coming over every day. That is way too much. Talk with your husband about what is acceptable (1-2 visits per week?) and then discuss how to implement this.
"12 yr old daughter lied - community service that’s a little… different
I’m principled. I don’t sweat the small stuff but I have rules with the big things. My daughter was given a direction to ask the teacher about some homework. She got out of doing most homework tasks the rest of the class completes by being given a specific worksheet that the teacher would work on with her because she has some specific things she’s working on improving. Neither of us could understand one of the modules so I told her to ask the teacher, so she gets it. 
She didn’t. 
I asked her if she had talked to the teacher. Her response was “yeah I just can’t remember what she said”. Mumma knew. I said ok, let me talk to your teacher because the plan isn’t working. She finally admitted she never asked the teacher… I don’t accept lying. It’s a big deal for me. The teacher is being amazing helping her with this and her efforts shouldn’t be wasted. The point is to learn this stuff. We don’t lie, and we’re not lazy and we ask for help from the people we trust when we need it. 

Cue Punishment. I’m don’t want to take things away anymore. I want to bolster with action so I decided some community service was in order. Then I thought… I’m going to get her to pick up dog poop. We live in an area where people don’t always pick up after their dogs. Too posh to pick up. I don’t care how long it takes, she needs to collect 10 stranger dog poops and dispose of them to save her neighbours shoes and cars. Is that wrong? We have a dog we walk ourselves and we pick up its poop always and tbh we collect random poops too, just a general kindness. But this makes it something she has to do… Is making my daughter do this, wrong?","I’m all about actions have consequences but I think they need to be as natural as possible. There isn’t really a real-world scenario where lying to someone ends in picking up dog poop. I think this punishment will cause resentment towards you to be honest and I think it will just make her get better at lying.

I think it would be better to sit and talk to her… why did she lie in the first place? Did she feel uncomfortable or embarrassed asking the teacher? Did she just forget? I think it’s also important to recognise whether the lying is sporadic or whether it’s becoming a pattern. Just from this example it doesn’t feel devious! 

You need to make it clear that the behaviour you didn’t like was the lying to you, rather than just not asking the teacher but it does seem like there will be a reason for it! 12 is hard especially if you feel like you can’t be totally honest with your parent and it’s only getting worse.

My parents raised me to be totally honest even if I did wrong and everything will get sorted as long as I tell the truth. At 15 I told my mum I was in a sexual relationship and wanted to go on the pill and she took me to the doctors straight away, no judgement and made sure I had condoms and was being safe. 

I also went to parties and tried drugs/alcohol, my parents weren’t happy about it but they created a safe space where I could be honest and I knew I could call them if I didn’t feel safe (which did happen!) and I was honest with where I was which my none of my friends were, they just got really good at lying. That only happened because my parents encouraged honesty and a safe space. I quickly came out of those risky behaviours using my own decision making, unlike a lot of my friends. I still have an excellent relationship with my parents. 

I know they’re extreme examples but the point is if you punish this behaviour with something gross, embarrassing and unrelated without actually talking to her, you’re only pushing her away which will lead to more lying, less trust and a worse relationship in the long-term. This honestly makes no sense to me.

I get that lying is an issue but idk, this feels like a very random and unrelated punishment for the sake of it. Have you tried to work with her on why she didn’t ask the teacher? Was she anxious about it and then lied because she was ashamed?"
"Car seat with longer crotch strap?
Does anyone know of a car seat that has a longer crotch strap? Or a slimmer crotch buckle set up. My child has a muscle/contracture disorder that makes them very stiff - they cannot bend their hips to 90 degrees, and cannot spread their legs to the side, so the strap is effectively too short and the buckle pinches/digs into their legs and makes car time pretty miserable.

Currently using the Graco 4ever deluxe extend2fit because of the extended rear facing leg room (they also cannot bend their knees at all), but will switch to forward facing soon because their legs really don't fit at this point, so looking to see if there is a better option!","Check the manufacturers website to see if they offer straps you can replace 

I would check for groups specific to your child's condition. You will probably get a good amount of recommendations Hey /u/lifeofhatchlings! It looks like you might be new here.

"Two toddler put down advice?
I have a 3.5f and a 2m, they both take about 1.5-2hr naps and I try and put them to nap at about the same time for my own sanity. Lately my son has had a really hard time with bedtime and he wants me there until he falls asleep which can range from 5-30min. 

My daughter just sits and waits while I’m shut in her brother’s room putting him down and I feel bad she’s just out there alone. If I try and leave to put her down while he’s awake he climbs out of bed and cries at the crack of his door until I get him or he falls asleep. Prior to this he just chatted to himself and played with toys in bed after we did the routine. 

I’m wanting to know if I should let him fuss? Let my daughter wait? Any other option I haven’t tried? My husband is on call 6 days a week and can’t consistently be home to help with bed time which makes it difficult.","Some days can she go down first and y’all do story time in her room and then go and put him down. And wait with him until he’s asleep. Or work on letting him fuss it out for a few if you want. Or on days you put him down first can she work on a “special” big sister project?

"Son invited to a birthday party for his friend and the friend’s twin. Two gifts?
Hi everyone, I am looking for opinions, and hopefully someone who has had experience with us. My son, 8 years old, has a friend who is a Twin. He was invited to their birthday party. My son is “friendly” with the Twin, but not on the same level as his friend. Basically, are we supposed to get gifts for both of the boys? I feel so awkward and I’m not sure what the norm/expectation for this is

Edit to clarify - by “friendly”, I meant that he is nice to him when they have interacted, but are not friends","Yes you know them both, so it’s polite that each person celebrating is to receive their own gift. I would get two gifts. I’d rather spend double the amount and come across as generous, than only buy one gift and risk being thought of as stingy"
"I feel like I'm losing my daughter, and I don't know how to fix it
I'm a 46-year-old transgender man (FTM), divorced with three children. My 16-year-old child and I used to be incredibly close. We've always shared a special bond, at least I thought so. We spend time together weekly, having fun in the community and discussing life. They use they/them pronouns, and I've always respected that. I thought I was doing a good job being present, supportive, and engaged.

Lately, though, everything's changed. Wren has been pulling away. They don't want to see me as often, barely respond to messages, and recently sent me a very intense message saying they're afraid of how I react during serious conversations. They said they avoid talking to me to ""keep the peace."" That I don't take accountability and always blame others. They said I was lucky they were even bothering to talk to me.

It was hard to hear.

What hurts most is that I didn't see it coming. I've been trying so hard to be a good parent. I know I am neurodivergent, which means I often miss emotional cues. I never meant to make them feel unsafe or unheard, but clearly, I have.

Making it harder is the influence of their stepmother. She's very controlling and seems to be pulling more of the strings in their household. My ex-husband doesn't intervene. I'm trying not to blame anyone, but it's hard not to feel like Wren's slipping further away because of that environment.

I've sent them a card with a message acknowledging what they said and explaining myself without making excuses. I included a blank piece of paper and an envelope, just in case they wanted to write back. I'm trying not to push, trying to be patient. Still, I'm also heartbroken and feel like I'm grieving a relationship that might not come back.

Has anyone experienced something similar? I know 16-year-olds often pull away from their parents, but it seemed so sudden to me. They say it’s been bad for a while, but that wasn’t my impression.

I will say this kid does tend to be overdramatic and is often bullied at school because of it. I’m sure that tendency is playing into this. I still don’t know what to do, but wait, and that sucks. I have my own sensitivity, which makes waiting without any due date so difficult.","She said you don’t take accountability and you don’t address this at all. She is straight up being unheard by you. Stop obsessing about the step mom and trying to blame others. When she says you didn’t take accountability, ask about why she feels that way. I feel like there’s a point where every child see’s their parent for what they are"
"Nearly 4 year old out of control!
My son is nearly 4. His behaviour has always been challenging since around 2.5 but now it’s got to the point where I cannot cope!!

It would be a very very long post if I was to write about all the things he does but so you get the gist he is extremely hyperactive at all points of the day, he launches things at me and his baby brother the second he doesn’t like something ie, being told to stop doing something he shouldn’t. He’s launched the baby bouncer, books, big toy cars, tv remote, you name it. He has a god awful scream! Again that he does when he’s being defiant. I try to leave the room away from the noise and he follows me doing it. I have bad ear ache today after a horrendous screaming episode. More recently he’s started, hitting, biting, scratching and kicking me. He is also extremely defiant! 

I have tired countless methods and techniques to try and help him but don’t get anywhere. We are in touch with the childrens centre for support. The GP won’t help. His preschool won’t help as he masks his behaviour while he’s there. I’m in DESPERATE need of help and support. Everyday is so so so hard and his brother is unsafe around him.

"Basic things a 3rd grader should know? Surprised my son doesn’t.
Despite thriving in traditional subjects such as math, reading, geography etc.. He doesn’t know some basic things I feel “we” knew very young. 

He didn’t know how many days are in each month (not just 30 or 31. But thought certain months had 32 or February had 27). He didn’t know any holidays except Christmas. He still takes like 60-90 seconds to tie each shoe (mainly either just slips them on or wears crocs or flip flops)

So when walking to the bus I like to just talk to him about random stuff (such as months and holidays now). Anyway, any other random things I could bring up to just widen his general common knowledge topics?

Thanks!",Memorize your phone number and make sure he knows how to use a cell phone and landline to make calls Some of you guys just need to read to your kids or watch some pbs kids shows. Basic stuff. Like there's a sesame Street song that lists almost all holidays. Tons of basics that we can take for granted.
"Deciding to have more kids
If you have more than 2 kids, why? 

My husband and I currently have 2 daughters (5&1). 

My husband has always only wanted one kid. I always wanted three.

After having one, he agreed one more would be okay.

Now, after almost two years of having two kids, he said he's willing to talk about the feasability of having a third. 

Now that it's on the table, I've been throwing around the pros and cons. My daughters adore each other. Now that my youngest is getting older, they are the best playmates. My only regret is that I feel like my oldest is getting less because she has to share it with her sister, but she is getting more because she has her, you know? A third would only be more love. More hilarious milestones, more fun. 

Financially we would be fine. I mean, I think we would, we have so much stuff from our first two, we might just need some clothes if it was a boy. I'm a sahm. We are by no means rich, but we live modestly and have what we need and most of what we want. We have a ton of support, but not locally. We live in a nice three bedroom home in a sought after school district. The only thing that we would really need is a new car, my current car can't fit 3 car seats. It's 10 years old and starting to need a lot of work anyways, so maybe that's not the worst. 

I would love a million kids, but 3 seems reasonable. 

Tldr: what made you decide to keep have more kids? Do you feel like each kid gets less because you have more?","Wife and I went back and forth on having 3 for an entire year. We had a bad annual tradition extended family vacation with a 1 year old and 3 year old and swore off having a third.

But then we got home and realized how much we love our own family so much, and the stress was really just vacationing with in-laws, so why not just grow our own family and do our own thing?

So now, third is on the way :) We have 3 and are done. Our first 2 are 17 months apart. My second and third are 6 years apart. We felt content for a long time, and left the door open for more. After a few years, we decided our family wasn’t complete. Now I feel like our family is perfect. 

I don’t feel like any of the kids are getting less. My older 2 are at way different stages of childhood than my baby, so I just don’t really see it that way. We make sure to have individual time with each kid."
"Am I doing too much or too little in terms of gifts?
My son will be 10 this year and I was planning to give him one of those retro video game things (switch knock off) but one thing led to another and I found myself booking a cruise using the funds we usually use for going back home for a month. I decided on a whim that we would travel to a near by country to do a short cruise trip there. He is CRAZY about cruises and in his rare times he is allowed to watch youtube he wants to watch about cruise ships. Not the crazy big ones with amusement parks regular ol ships excites him too. So I booked it and fully paid. There will be a few days in the city we will be doing the cruise from so I also plan to take him to the water park which claims to be the biggest in the south half of the world. It has attractions I know he would want to try.

So now I don't know if I should be giving him the video game thing along with the cruise gift? Cruise is a huge out of comfort zone for me, to travel, to carry all the mental load etc as an autistic single mom is so hard on my nerves so i am doing this for him. I was thinking I can design his birthday like a treasure hunt theme where at the end his gift will be tickets? And game boy thing could be for his next birthday? 

I kinda don't want to do both at the same time because I am afraid he will be glued to the screen during the cruise. But also the airline we will be flying has no entertainment system and he flies easy only because of the planes we used to take had them. So I can totally get the help of the screen.What would you do?","What a wonderful mum you are either gifts are fantastic. I am also a single mum so I can empathise with the stress that travelling alone with your kids can bring. 

I personally would gift the cruise and leave the game boy for another occasion. A cruise is above and beyond"
"6 month old pulling to stand
My son will turn 6 months in a couple days. He learnt to roll from back to tummy at 3 months and tummy to back at 5 months. He has been coming on his palms, and pivoting well on his tummy, comes on all fours, lifts bum to try and scoot forward, but not crawling yet. He almost sits unassisted till he just throws his body backwards and falls. 
Recently he has started pulling to stand if im holding his hands (even if its not over his head). I am wondering if its okay for him to do it or I should avoid it till he starts crawling so he doesnt skip milestones? Im not concerned about tummy time duration because he is on his tummy pretty much all day whenever he is on the floor. He also sleeps on his tummy all night.","Lots of kids skip crawling, as it turns out. I wouldn't worry about it, personally. From what I've heard, scootching on their bum is just as valid as crawling because many kids never crawl, just scootch. Kids do different things at different times. Sounds like you have one who’s ready to be on the move. I wouldn’t worry about it from a development standpoint."
"Feeling really lonely as a teen mom
I am a teen mom (18f) of my wonderful and beautiful 2yr old son. I just started college last week (full time) and am working on getting my son into daycare. I have worked my ass off. I graduated hs this last summer, ive worked to start an IRA and set up emergency savings, i already have my 4 years of college tuition covered, i have an amazing coparenting relationship with my fathers son, and im saving to move out of my parents house. 

Ive got everything set up exactly how I want it. I love school and my job(s). But i still feel like something is missing. I feel really lonely. 

Ive been in multiple relationships since me and my sons dad broke up, three months after he was born. After my last relationship I hooked up with my baby daddy and realized I need to get my shit together. I want to be loved, and i sought that, but I'm now at a place where i wanna be able to live without a relationship. 

I havent been out of a relationship for more than 6 months in 5 years. I havent had any close girl friends since middle school. Despite having a robust community (moms groups, college community for moms, family) I feel the need for deeper connections outside of romantic relationships. I feel so lost in this place of wanting to be 18, going out with friends and having fun, and makimg the right decisions for my son and my future. 

Any words of wisdom appreciatwd.","I'm 26m now, but was left a single dad not long after son was born, I understand just how hard it is.. Hats off to you.
I know you feel like you are alone, I felt the same but my dad pushed me to get involved, so I found a local young parents group on Facebook, from there I went from one strength to another. 
I met my current partner at Judo training of all places, just be open to anything, great people come along as life moves on. 


You have been blessed with a little man I'm sure loves you.

Take that time luv 🙏🏾 be alone and wait for your king to find you."
"How do we feel when adults call out your kid for not saying hi back?
My son is 7 and he rarely says hi back to neighbors when they say it. I tell him it's the polite thing to do to at least say hi back, even if he doesn't want to have a conversation with them, but most of the time he still won't say anything despite our talks about it. Today, one of my neighbors said hi to him and he didn't say it and then she came back and said ""hey, you didn't say hi back."" I feel like she is really saying this to me, the parent, as a commentary on my parenting. I felt called out, even though they don't know what goes on behind doors, that I do make so much effort to teach my kids manners. What would you do here? I told her that he was just having a rough day (he kind of was, just came back from being poked at doc office) and apologized. I remember being the same at this age and eventually grew out of it.","I don’t think this is a harmful scenario to just let it be.  You’ve told him that it’s perceived as rude to not respond to people, so now he got called out for it.  If you feel judged, I think that’s on you, but you could always respond and say “yes, we’ve talked about how that is perceived as rude to people” and let it be.  It’s still asserting what you’ve been trying to teach him without excusing his behavior, but also addresses the neighbor and lets them know this is something you, the parent, are working on that he, the child, just hasn’t picked up on yet. I think it’s a good thing sometimes. It gives kids awareness. Not acknowledging a greeting is rude. Nothing against your parenting at all."
"How long to get used to it?
I dropped my daughter off for her freshman year of college yesterday. I have an older son who has been in the Navy for 3 years. He has a pretty safe job so besides not seeing him for long periods of time it is not stressful. He is good at his job, getting promoted, winning awards, etc. 
I am technically an empty nester but my sd is 17 and lives with us full time. My husband handles everything related to her so I have no responsibilities. How long until I stop feeling like I need to be checking on my daughter, if she will be home for dinner, what time she’ll be home or what friend’s house she is at?","3 of my 4 are out of the house. My 24 year old lives with her boyfriend in an apartment about 30 minutes away, my 20 year old attends college in another state, and my 18 year old is in the military. Just my 15 year old remains home but the house is still quiet. 

You became used to them being gone over time but it's certainly a little weird at first. This is the quietest my house has ever been and I'm adjusting to the silence. It helps that I'm close with my kids and they call/text when they can but it's just one of those things you have to go through to get used to. I dropped my son off a lil over a week ago… I started a notes app to add all the silly things I think of all day or questions I have, to make sure he’s ok or the dorm is fully stocked. Then go over it when he does have time to chat and laugh at mom overthinking lol 😝 we are still texting or snapping one another quickly throughout the day and that helps. Also life 360 is set to go off as well. I’m always here to chat if you need to!! We got this!! They got this!! 😊🤍😊"
"Another child threatened my daughter that he'd shoot her on the bus.
I can't. I just can't. My daughter is only nine years old. The other child is younger than that.

I did all the right things. I notified the school. I called transportation. Everyone took the threat seriously and handled it within twenty-four hours. Kids say stupid things, but in this day and age, you just can't take any chances. Kids dont understand the consequences and get ahold of guns. You just never know.

They have it all on camera. She was just sitting there in her pretty dress that she was so excited to wear. The other kid starts calling her a b*tch and then promises to bring a gun on the bus and shoot her in the back of the head. It was so violent, so sudden. No provocation. 

My daughter is terrified and I'm still shaking and crying when she isn't looking. I'm trying to get her in to see the councilor. I just don't understand. He didn't even know her. I'm not okay.","I’d honestly contact the police to make sure the school takes this seriously. The school  should have a zero tolerance policy for things like this I am so sorry that happened. That is terrifying. Is it possible for her to not ride the bus for a bit?

"How much say do you give a child over seeing relatives?
My daughter (6, adopted) has a biological sister who lives in a group home. The girls have had play dates every other week (with exceptions, of course) since the adoption. 

We were away for most of the summer, and assumed the routine would be back to normal upon our return, but my daughter didn’t want to go and see her sister last weekend. We thought she was just still experiencing a bit of jet lag or being unsettled by being back in her routine at home, and we took her for the visit anyway. When she came home, she said she didn’t have fun, and doesn’t want to go back. We talked with her and her main points were that her bio sister is “annoying” and “bossy” and she wants to be at home to play with her own toys or do things with us. We said we understood and tabled the discussion, thinking we would monitor it. But today she noticed on the calendar that she’s scheduled for another visit and got upset, saying she doesn’t want to go. 

I’m a bit at a loss. If this was any play date with a friend I wouldn’t make her go. I don’t want her to think her feelings don’t matter. But this isn’t a playmate it’s her bio sister. I’ve scheduled a meeting with her psychologist to discuss it but she’s off until the middle of the month, and I want to have my head straight on before the meeting. If we let her not go and she never wants to go again, then what? Will she resent us for not having forced her to go later? But if we force her to go, what are we teaching her? That what she wants and her time doesn’t matter? The truth is if it was any other family member she didn’t want to see I wouldn’t make her go either, but is that the wrong approach to take? She’s young to be “making” these decisions but she’s old enough to know where she wants to be and I don’t want to ignore that.","How old is bio sister?  Are you present when they are having their meeting?  

My initial thought is that bio sister is older and probably sees little sister having everything she wants.  A family being the main one.  It is very possible that bio sis is being mean and bossy, because there is jealousy and resentment.   Does bio sis even want to see little sister? Is she being forced to see her little sister? My 6 year old would probably prefer not to see any of her bio siblings either (they are also bossy and annoying), but unfortunately they live with her so she doesn’t have the option. 

I think in this situation you really need to consider long term consequences vs short term feelings/opinions of a child who is not mature enough to understand empathy or long term consequences. I would think it would be important to continue to foster a relationship between the siblings because someday it will be really important to them. 

However, you also don’t want to push it to a point that your daughter resents the visits. Is there a way you could make their quality time together more enjoyable for your daughter? Like go out to do an activity she really enjoys? If seeing her sibling is associated with getting to go to her favourite play place or getting to have her favourite ice cream then maybe she would be more open to it."

As a child, my childhood was not good. I don't like talking about it. Teenage years were not better. Anywho, I have a husband and a daughter who is 8. I try to be a good mom, but I feel like a failure and like a failed her. When she was young(5ish?), her father almost died because of liver failure, and he had to stay in the hospital for like a month and a half. I went with him, and she stayed with 2 sets of grandparents that whole time. They are not great role models in different ways, but it was all the support I had at the time. During this time, I feel like I failed her because I went with him. She was so sweet and nice. Since then, we have lived with husband's mom and husband. They are good to us. We've been here for around 3 years-ish. I feel as she's gotten older she's hateful toward me and has an attitude every time she talks to me. Idk... I know I'm not the best( I have anger problems, mental problems,  severe anxiety and stress, shitty job, etc). I just feel like crying all the time now. I can't talk to anyone because I have no friends, can't talk to husband because he doesn't understand,  can't talk to mother-in-law because she'll say turn to god and that's a no for me. They used to play argue, and we've gotten them to stop because she starts arguments all the fricking time since that happened. Idk what to do. It's either she gets what she wants or she pouts, turns hateful toward me when I say no, and she gets pissy because she doesn't get her way. She acts like I beat her when I raise my voice( I try not to, but she pushes me to my f*ING limit). I don't like yelling at her, I try not to. I don't like telling her 20 times to clean her room, and she acts like she's 2. I don't want to talk to a therapist because I have trouble talking about my feelings, emotions,etc. I try to get her to talk about how she's feeling thinking that would help with outbursts, but she refuses to talk to me or how she feels. I don't know what to do anymore. She's fine when dad is around, normal girl occasional attitude but nothing overwhelming,  only when it's just us. I don't smack her, I don't bust her, but I can't ground her because that does nothing. the corner does nothing. Idk what to do. We were trying to get our own place, and we try not to talk finances around her, but she always talks about us being poor, etc.  There are just so many things in my head. It doesn't matter if anyone responds to this. I just feel like giving up and wanted to vent to something.","I can't really help you with in-laws, but some things I did for my kids at this age when they were not listening or uncooperative. 

I ask once, I tell second, I do it myself third. 

If you ask her to clean her room, sometimes that may mean helping to guide her through what that means, the different steps, ""Can you pick up your toys, now the books, now the bed..."" That kind of thing. At this age, they may still need some guidance through larger tasks. If the room mess is overwhelming I might do something to pare down that room and make it easier to pick up. Or maybe go through it a little more often. Maybe a before-bed pick up so it's less overwhelming. 

If I've asked once and she refuses, I tell a second time, ""Please pick up these toys, I will be back in 5 mins to check on you."" ...After 5 mins I come back and if she's ignoring or not picking up, I just do it myself. But that might mean that books and toys get put away in the garage. Or it might mean that b/c I had to spend my time picking up a messy bedroom there isn't time to go to the park that day or do some other fun thing they were looking forward to. ""Well, mommy is far too tired from cleaning up your room all alone to go to the park. So we'll try again tomorrow."" I always try to give a chance to start over the next day and try again. The next morning I may reiterate the behavior we want to see. ""Today is going to be a good day with listening and being helpful!"" or whatever thing went wrong the day before. 

Let her pout and be hateful"
"How should I handle rudeness and cruelty from my middle schooler?
Vulnerable post today. I have four kids and I feel like I have always been close to them, but within the last year my daughter who is very nearly 13 has become extremely rude and even cruel at times. I get that she's going through puberty and middle school is hard, so I expect it to some degree, but it's been getting to a point where I'm wondering WTF I have done wrong raising her because she is so damn mean. I don't know how much I should let slide because of her age and and how much I should punish her for. I also don't know the best way to punish her, because I'm a big fan of natural consequences but I'm not sure what a natural consequences of her making nasty comments to me could possibly be. 

I hit my breaking point this week when I was driving her to her sport, and she commented about how all her friends are surprised that she has such a young mom (it's true, she was born when I was 20). Then she went on to say, very viciously, that it sucks for her that I'm young because then she'll have to have me around longer. It felt like a goddamn knife in my heart because my own mom died when I was 18 and I have spent every day of my life since missing her. 

From the day my daughter was born I have vowed to be the best mom I can be for her. I have always been terrified of dying young like my mom did and leaving my kids without a mother. To hear my own child say that they would like me to die sooner hurt so much. My own mother's death and everything I went through after was so traumatic that I still cannot talk about it. 

The only thing I could even bring myself to say at the time was, ""well, luckily for you longevity doesn't run in the family so maybe you won't have me around too long."" I then dropped her off and sobbed in my car. This was last week and it's been bringing me to tears nearly every day. I feel like I need to address it with her, but like I said, I literally cannot talk about my mom's death. 

I have been doing a lot of reflecting and wondering why she apparently hates me so much, and I don't know what I could have done to provoke so much animosity. I bend over backwards for her and her interests. I have supported her in her music, her (extremely expensive!!!) competitive sport, and make sure to have lots of one on one time with her. I try to talk about her feelings and always tell her how much I love her. I sacrifice so much so she can have a better life than I did. I go without a lot so that we can afford the things that are important to her, but it seems like it is never enough for her. 

I have friends with kids her age whose children still hug them and tell them they love them, and it breaks my heart that my own daughter pushes me away when I try to hug her and makes it clear that she does not love or respect me. She has said so many hurtful things and I tell her she needs to be respectful but it never seems to make a difference. Even her own friend called her out recently and I overheard her asking my daughter why she's so mean to her mom and telling her she should be nicer. 

What am I supposed to do about my daughter's cruelty? Other than that, she is amazing. She's extremely smart and gets straight As in an advanced program at school. She plays two instruments very well. She's heavily involved in a competitive sport. She seems very kind and empathetic to other kids (so why so cruel to me and her younger brothers?) 

I'm starting to feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with her. I spend so much time trying to have a positive relationship with her. I take her out for her favorite treat just the two of us so we can talk. I make sure she gets plenty of time with her friends. I spend SO MUCH time and money on her music and sport. I'm talking hours and hours every week and about $600/mo plus other expenses for her music and competitive sport. We are financially stable, but we are definitely not wealthy, and this is a LOT of money to us. I have literally put off receiving medical care for myself because I know how important it is to her and I want to support her. Despite all that, she is constantly being cruel to me and her siblings too (today she was belittling her brother for not being as good at piano as she is). 

How am I supposed to handle this? I'm lost and extremely hurt.","I would have turned the car around and taken her home. 

You're her parent, you are obligated to make sure she is fed, clothed, loved, safe, and educated. You aren't obligated to taxi her around to activities and pay for expensive sports and lessons. Those are privileges.

If she can't treat her family members with decency and respect, then she has not earned privileges. Hooooly smokes. If my child made a comment about wishing I were dead while I was chauffeuring her to one of her activities, I would have said something loudly and angrily and I would have turned the car around and gone home. And let her cry, rage, whatever, until she calmed down and gave me a sincere meaningful apology. That is so far beyond the level of what you should let slide for her age.


To be honest, I think she might be spoiled. I think you have done too much catering to her wants and too much letting things slide, and not enough boundaries and teaching kindness and gratitude.


I think you should continue taking her out to foster your connection and communication. But she needs some real consequences when she is acting like this. And, you do actually need to prioritize your own medical care. If this means she can't do her activity anymore, so be it.


I think you should get individual therapy to work on your sense of self worth and your confidence in parenting. I also think you should do family therapy with her."
"Kindergarten experiences?
Throwaway account but I’m curious what everyone’s experience with kindergarten is. 

My son started this week at a private Christian school. When we toured we were told limited to no screen time which is important to us. It’s his 4th day and he said his teacher doesn’t read books to them, she puts shows of people reading books. My son is very honest so I’m inclined to trust him. 

I’m just wondering if your kindergartners are watching tv at school and if that’s normal. Are they reading books? I feel that is SO important for children.","No that's not a typical kindergarten experience. At my kiddo's (public) school they may have like digital books they look at on a tablet with the option of having text read aloud. But definitely not videos of people reading books instead of the teacher reading a book to the class As a former teacher, I would occasionally do this as a way to engage the kids with something to prevent chaos while I managed an unexpected situation.... like another child's crisis behavior, documenting urgent information, looking at admin info regarding severe weather, etc... stuff that COULDN'T wait. It was RARE. Before getting too upset, I would ask the teacher about it. Kids exaggerate. Not saying he is about this, but act like there's a chance when speaking to her (because he could be!). If he keeps talking about it or she says that she does this frequently, bring in the principal. Because that is unacceptable for any age."
"Playground - whether to discipline other parents’ children?
My husband and I are debating what is an appropriate level of communication with other people’s kids at the park. Our son is 17 months old and very unassuming, but is big for his age so can come across as older. We have on more than one occasion had a bigger kid (clearly over 2-3 years old) grab toys right out of my son’s hand or push him over to get to a toy he’s playing with. Sometimes these are his personal toys and sometimes they are the public toys at the playground. When it’s been a significantly older child, I have said, “do you think it’s a nice thing to do, taking toys from someone else without asking?” And generally they reconsider their actions and either give the toy back or put it on the ground. I’ve never had a parent say anything to me, but my husband is worried that it comes across as trying to discipline the other kids. My personal feeling is I would want a parent to say the same thing to my child if he were misbehaving or treating another kid that way, but I don’t know how other parents would react. 
In case it’s helpful context, we live in an affluent area where parents err towards the “gentle parenting” mode, or at least that’s how it seems based on how they communicate with their kids at the playgrounds.","With a toddler that young (in the 2-3 range) I wouldn't ask ""do you think that's a nice thing to do"" as a literal stranger to them, but I do say ""No thanks!"" and stop the behavior if it is potentially dangerous or my kid isn't into it. If it gets more severe, I will say ""whose kid is this?"" lol and that's always worked. I never have a problem correcting other people's kids if no one else is stepping in. I don't lecture or yell, I just say ""No thank you"" in that Mom Means Business voice (y'all know the one)."
"Daughter (6) was left unattended in classroom. Need advice.
Yesterday,  My 6 year old daughter came home and told us that her teacher left her in the classroom for 10 minutes and forgot about her. My wife went to back to school night the same day, where she saw the teacher and the school principal inside the class. No one said anything to my wife and upon her return home, she sent an email to the teacher inquiring about our daughter's story. The email below is from her teacher.

""Thank you for reaching out about this. This is exactly what happened. It was a misunderstanding, and I felt terrible that this happened to (daughter). We've been working on lining up quietly especially because we are next to a 3rd grade class that is still learning while we are lining up. I don't want there to be disruptions to their classroom. So, when students are talking, I ask them to ""try again"" they are supposed to just walk back to their desk then come straight back out to the line. I've been doing this since last week so I mistakenly thought my students understood that they were to come right back to the line. We walked to lunch and (daughter) was still in the class. Another teacher saw her a few minutes later and walked her over to the lunch tables. Principal spoke with (daugther) about this and made sure she was okay. I also went out and found her on the playground to talk to her, to see if she was okay, and to apologize about the misunderstanding. I gave her a big hug and explained to her that this was a mistake on my part and I was deeply sorry she was scared. I felt terrible! I also want her to feel safe at school. I would never want my students to feel scared. I will continue to communicate with (daughter) and make sure she feels safe at school, in the classroom, and with me as her teacher. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out again.""

End email:

While, we appreciated the email back, we still feel bothered that not only was our 6 year was left unattended but there was a huge lack of communication to us about the instance until we reached out.

I am looking for advice on how to handle this situation. We obviously will speak with the principal but would welcome any other thoughts or suggestions. We definitely do not want our daughter to feel like she did anything wrong and don't want her to be afraid of being punished like this in the future.

  
UPDATE:  
Thank you all for your replies. I spoke with my wife, and we are not going to follow up with the principal. I do understand it was a mistake and not a punishment towards my daughter.","It sounds like the situation has been resolved. The teacher and principal took immediate action, talked to your daughter, consoled her, and moved on. To me, this wouldn’t warrant a phone call home because there was no safety issue or concern. Your child was spotted within minutes, brought to her class, and talked to. She was also still safe inside of the classroom. What else are you hoping to get from the situation? I'd be asking my 6 year old why she isn't lining up quietly and respectfully like she's been asked to do. The rest of this is just mama bear anger and you'll be a lot happier if you learn to let the little stuff go."
"To the moms who discipline with only a glare...
How the hell do you do it? 😂

When my daughter acts up, my wife will glare at her. Sometimes say ""Knock it off"" or ""I said stop it"" and 99% of the time, that's all it takes. But me? She'll run my dumb ass in circles! (My wife doesn't yell, scream, hit, or threaten. I know someone will bring this up.) 

Someone please explain the power of the mom glare! 😂","You need to set rules and follow them.


They will absolutely take advantage of any inconsistency in your discipline. My kids know I don’t bluff"
"Parental advice
My son (19) has moved out last year, he's since moved in with a 40 year old female that he claims he loves.

A. He doesn't have a GED/diploma. HS dropout.
B. He doesn't have a driver's license
C. He doesn't have a job and struggles in keeping one.

My question is this; (I plan to show him this thread too fyi) how do I convince him to move back in with me and get his life together so he can be a productive member of society?

Part of the problem is his gaming addiction (50+hrs a week) and fear of going back to school (he was bullied pretty badly) to finish his ged.

Edit:
Hes moved 1107 miles away
She's disabled and unemployed. Idk how she has a place to live tbh.
She has children older than him.","You can’t

You tell him your concerns, then tell him you’ll always love him and will welcome him home with open arms wherever he wants to come back He's an adult. Nothing you can do and really none of your business really. Leave him alone. It's his life he has to live it how he wants to. Hard to accept but true. Keep in contact and make sure he always knows you are there and he can come back to you if he wants to."
"Sleep issues  - 3 year old
My once perfect sleeper is now having issues and won’t fall asleep on his own. He’s got used to one of his parents laying with him. If he wakes up in the middle of the night he calls for one of us as well.

I’ve been told to let him cry it out or use the Ferber method. We did this at 6 months old and it worked after 2 nights. 

I really have a hard time, especially when he keeps calling for me. I feel like in his little brain I’m abandoning him. People tell me that he’s just trying to get what he wants. He seemed in such a panic. 

I want to do what is best for my child. I also don’t want to make a mistake and damage him. Does anyone have any experience with going through this? Anyone have any advice?

"Visiting - weird behavior
We're currently visiting my parents. They were so generous and let us stay at their house. Among a myriad of other behaviors I don't want my 4yr old picking up, my youngest brother (11) constantly makes moaning sounds. I know that can be normal at his age, but he does it even when tickling my son or holding my 1 yr old baby. Despite me expressing how it makes me uncomfortable, my parents aren't worried it. My 4yr old is starting to make the sounds. Am i just being obnoxious about it and it's really not a big deal?
We're here for another week and I don't know if I should just chill out or find another place to stay. 

(My brother and the kids are always supervised when together)","Unless your brother is neurodivergent, I would not say it is normal for an 11 year old to constantly make moaning sounds. Tell your parents that if they do not get to the bottom of this behavior, you will no longer be able to visit. Is he in school? Do you know if he does it there? Moaning sounds, especially constantly, is not normal at all.
You need to stay somewhere else and try to talk with your parents about your brother’s behavior."
"My kid has no friends in his class
This is just a vent but my son is going into grade 9, he already struggles with liking school and he just found out that all of his friends are in one class and he is in the other grade 9 class with no friends. He is devastated, I feel that this will ruin his grade 9 year as I know from experience how tough it can be as a teen having no friends in your class, not to mention he will be left out of his friend group now since he they will all be in the same class without him.  In my sons school his homeroom class will be the same class he does all of his core subjects with.  I emailed the school in hopes of a miracle and the possibility they will move him to the other class.  fingers crossed!

signed one stressed mama",I think asking to switch for this reason is absolutely ridiculous. Tell your kid to focus on making new friends. Can you get him transferred?
"Dance mom friends/weird issue
Hi! So this is probably going to seem very strange. For context my husband and I have several kids. We have a daughter who is 10 that does dance team, and has for several years. Two other girls became her close friends, they have sleepovers etc. we roomed together at a dance convention, and I feel semi close to their moms, we talk on the phone laugh etc. one mom is very gossipy and it’s become very apparent lately, so the other mom and I don’t like gossip and are just trying to be kind as our girls are close. Our three girls have iPads and I would let my daughter FaceTime them for about an hour or so during the day in the summer. I am very good about monitoring what goes on with her iPad, and she has a ton of parental controls. Today at dance though I was sitting outside with the two girls moms and another mom who we like but her daughter doesn’t hang with our girls. The mom we don’t hang with I will call Ashley, said to the gossipy mom who I will call Angela “did you ever tell her (meaning me) about the phone calls”. Angela said what phone calls? Ashley said the ones over the summer? Angela responds with “oh yeah, when the girls would talk on the phone your daughter (she used her name) wouldn’t hang up the group calls the right way. So everytime my daughter would call it would just auto connect, and she told me and so we would sit and listen to what was going on at your house.” They did this several times, I have no idea how long or how many times, and no one ever said a word to me. I literally had no idea group calls stayed open if someone didn’t hang up. The iPad is effectively taken away, but I feel like this is insanely creepy for an adult to do. What do I do? I feel uncomfortable. I was so mad and all I could think to do was laugh and say if you are a fan just say that. But I’m really freaked out.","Angela is not your friend. 

This is so invasive. I can’t think of any reasonable or even innocent reason why an adult would do this. That is soooo weird. If you feel close enough, bring it up with her. If not just create distance and stay away from her."
"My child wants to change their name
I've got a weird one here.

My child (10) just started public school, and suddenly they have asked to change their name. Here's the kicker: this isn't an effort to express their gender identity in another way.

If they wanted to explore more non-conforming gender roles (non-binary/genderfluid/transgender), I would be entirely, completely supportive of that. My spouse and I are both non-conforming to gender roles, and I could understand if our child wanted to explore something similar.

I did some digging, and I recently discovered part of their motivation for the change: it is the name of their favorite YouTuber. I don't even know where to start here.

I feel a level of guilt being judgemental of my child's choice to change their name, but there also isn't anything inherently wrong with it. A rose by another name and all that, but am I wrong for thinking the reason for the change is just a little bit flippant and not a good motivation to change their identity, especially when that identity is being lifted from another, living person?

Weigh in here, folks.","I’d just call them what they want to be called.  I wouldn’t allow them to legally change it at 10, because 10 year olds make bad choices, but sure, I’d call them what they want. For what it's worth, I wanted to change my name million times growing up. First, I wanted Dawn, then Angel and lord knows what after that. I'm sure I went by Lillith during high-school for a moment. My parents were so blase about it. I never did change my name."

"3 year old - playing or babysitting
This is part vent and part asking for input. I have three kids 9(m)7(f)6(m). We have new-ish neighbors (less than 6 mos) that we’ve briefly spoken to a few times. 
They have boys (10,7) and a girl (3). The 3 year old is VERY 3, not a kid that’s mature for her age or anything like that. 
We also have a neighbor 5(f). The 5(f) neighbor comes over to play with my daughter. While she’s 5(f) here I can get other things done and don’t necessarily need to hover. The parents of the 3 year old girl let their daughter play at the girl (5)s house. 
Today girl (5) came over to play with my daughter. 
I was getting work done outside when girl (3) came with her mom and asked if she could play inside. 
I said “I’m sorry but I am doing some things around the house and can’t supervise”. The mom seemed really upset and the kid left crying. I apologized again but it still seemed like the mom was irritated or didn’t quite understand why I wouldn’t want her to drop off her 3 year old at my house to play with the older two girls (5&7).
Am I wrong? Is this normal? I don’t want it to be weird.  Is there a better way to communicate this boundary?","I don't think you did anything wrong.  I'm curious about the interaction.

"Exhausted mother - how to scold child
Pretty much title sums it up - my son is 2, he will be 3 in 3 months. We have been very lucky with him so far and still are of course.

He’s a great sleeper and a great eater but lately the tantrums have really started. I knew when people talked about how the threes were when the trouble really started that this was coming, but wow it’s hard. 
Every single time he doesn’t get his way it’s screaming and throwing himself on the floor. 
I’m a gentle person, I grew up in a very angry household with constant screaming and blaming. I do not want that for my son. I’m not trying to put him in fight or flight and wreck his nervous system. 

However, how the hell do you punish your child. Today he was particularly bold. I know it’s tiredness. His naps are now over with his preschool - although I’m trying to insist they let him nap still - he’s a lovely child. Sweet personality and really gentle - but nothing works. He tells me why he’s in trouble “I hit mama” but nothing changes. He doesn’t listen, I try to be gentle and say he has 2 minutes then he has to listen but it leads to a tantrum. 

What has been the most effective way of teaching your child manners.

He is not allowed screen time anyway so I can’t even take anything off him. I try natural consequences but mostly these instances occur out in public where I just have to pick him up and carry him off because there’s no other option. 

At home I can take a toy off him but I don’t want to threaten to send him to bed because he’s an amazing sleeper so I don’t want bed to be a punishment. 

Any tips are greatly welcome because I am tired and I want to go back to enjoying our time together. Not constantly feeling everything’s a battle.","I hear you. We've welcomed a new born this summer and our almost 3 year old is adjusting as are we.  Because of our lack of sleep, our patience is not the same and we were at ends with how things were going with us and them.  I decided that we would start a sticker reward system where they would earn a sticker for good behavior and loose a sticker for not listening after asking and counting to 3 or for hitting/bitting (would loose 2 stickers).  After 5 stickers we allowed tv (because we are okay with it for now as we are adjusting with newborn) and after 10 would get an ice cream or something else.  They were very motivated by getting stickers and the warning of loosing a sticker worked really well.  There were less meltdowns from all of us and really trying to recognize all the good listening and helping and positive as much as possible.  I don't know if its correct parenting, but it was a game changer for us.

Edit:  just to add, also instead of timeout, we do a calm down time, where they go to the stairs and count to ten with their fingers breathing in big and when they are calmer we try again.  This also works better than a time out for us.  They have to then say their sorry If they hurt someone and we talk about what happened briefly. I never used punishments, at all. 
I also didn't find rewards to be effective . For the same reason, they are external motivators rather than internal. When the internal chaos voils over, no external prize or penalty  can stop the explosion.

With a toddler the most effective way is managing the situation and prevention. 
When they get a little bit older , we do problem solving .

Screaming and tantrums, as exhausting as they are, are not a problem to solve. They are a.normal, age appropriate expression of emotion and the toddler needs help learning to regulate themselves."
"At what age do you start giving pocket money? Not chores related
My daughter's turning 5 in a couple of weeks so we're thinking of starting a family rule of ""pocket money starts at 5"". Probably a couple of pounds a week regardless of behaviour/chores etc.

 Curious to know what other families do.","I don’t really give my kids money unless they’re going on a school field trip or somewhere with friends. They are 7 and 8. 

They have money from birthdays and whatnot, but we’re pretty selective in how they spend it, if they do. We don't give a regular allowance until they are old enough to have regular chores.  The pocket money isn't *tied* to regular chores, but the idea is, they work for the family, the family provides money for them.

At five we would just give a few dollars to spend when we went somewhere like a yard sale, the fair, out with Grandma.  Once they started having things they wanted to save up for we started more regular money.

Right now my kids get $10/week deposited into their accounts for saving and then they net about $5 each/week selling eggs (feed costs come out of sales).  I still give them a little extra if they go somewhere special, especially if they go without us."
"Son’s new purchase broke, company isn’t responding.
Sooo, my 10 year old gets $20 for mowing our lawn. He’s a bit hit and miss on it, and treats it like gig work(e.g. he only works when he wants something) but it gets me out of mowing in tha durty south about 60% of the time. 

He saved up $60 to buy a Redragon Magic Wand Mini Pro keyboard and he was sooooo excited. It worked great for about 2-3 months and then it suddenly quit working. 

I did all the things.  Reset, hard reset, reinstall drivers, let it sit powered on so the battery absolutely dies, everything I could think of, but the keys just won’t work. 

Finally I tried contacting Micro Center, no dice, as it’s been more than 30 days. 

Contact manufacturer………aaaannnnnddd, they aren’t replying to my emails and I can’t find a phone number. 

Question is.  Should I show my son the hard lesson, at ten, that sometimes you get burned, or do I buy him a new one?  Clearly I could go 2 ways on purchasing a new one, tell him I bought it, or perform a rouse by pretending I got a new one from redragon. 

Thoughts from the random members of reddit?","I think it’s a decent chance to teach him the lesson that sometimes you get burned. Maybe to soften the blow you could go halfsies with him on a new keyboard (I’d get a different brand, maybe try SteelSeries which is what my gamer partner uses and seems to be the same price point). Did you buy it with a credit card? Maybe you can inquire about a charge back for the product"
"Medical office tech discouraged vaccines
Yesterday, my husband brought our daughter to the optometrist.  As per normal a technician did all the initial assessments with the machines and color blindness etc. 

As part of the medical questionnaire about headaches and comorbidities, the technician asked my 11-year-old if she had recently had any vaccines.  

My husband mentioned that we were planning to get our flu and covid boosters this weekend.  The technician looked at him and said ""I would not advise that.  That could be very dangerous.""

My daughter giggled nervously and the technician said to her ""This is very serious sweetie. Don't let them put stuff into your body. ""

And the doctor came in and finished the eye exam.  When they told me about this. After returning home I was irate.  My husband thinks it would be Karen behavior to call the practice but I also feel like since the tech interacted with my minor child and contradicted her father in front of her. Something should be said. 

When I asked my daughter about it and she said that it made her feel very uncomfortable, but she wouldn't have brought it up to me if my husband hadn't told me to ask her.

Do I call and complain?  Or do I just tell my daughter that some adults have their own opinions and we don't always listen to them?","No, the technician is _ridiculously_ out of line and you should complain (though there's a chance that their boss agrees with them). I don't know what the licensing for optometrists and techs is where you live, but if it were me I'd be looking into whether it's possible to file a formal complaint at that level too. Absolutely call and complain. That’s unacceptable."
"Question about tantrums
Question about tantrums

Hi, I’m a first time mom and I’m just looking for people’s experience with their toddlers tantrum and to see what’s normal and what raises concern. I’m not trying to complain I just want to know if it’s something I should be concerned about and look more into. My 21 month old has been having very frequent and pretty intense tantrums. Basically every time I have to tell him to do something (something as simple as go downstairs for breakfast or upstairs to get changed) he throws himself on the ground and is almost inconsolable. Sometimes it can be a 30secs to a few minutes and sometimes it’s 10-15 mins. He refuses almost everything like leaving the park, bath time, trying to get him in the high chair or car seat. He’s always been difficult like that even as a baby but I just don’t know if this is normal toddler behavior or not. I know there’s the terrible twos and I think he is teething so maybe that’s making them worse. I just want to know peoples experiences at this age. I hang around other moms and kids close to his age and they don’t seem to have meltdowns every time they have to leave a park of playgroup. Idk I just want to make sure everything is ok with my son.","There are a lot of different sources for the same ideology, but letting them melt and helping them process their feelings is a long term win. Dr. Becky’s Good Inside has great resources for this. Same with the Art of Accomplishment Group with Joe Hudson. 

They’re gonna learn how to handle their feelings by letting them feel them, with your guidance. Other kids not having tantrums isn’t a great barometer. It’s possible the other parents shut their kids down at the first glimpse of uncomfortable feelings/behavior. 

Be uncomfortable. Feel embarrassed if you feel that while it’s happening, but stick through it. Other people’s opinions of your parenting aren’t gonna be relevant for your child years later. 

It’s short term hard, but long term a huge win. 

Parenting Beyond Power is a great read for this type of stuff as well. 

You got this! My wife coincidentally sent this to me this morning, our son is just becoming a toddler.  This might help you some.

"Apathy after kid gone to college
I have 2 kids, 10f and 18m. I dropped off my son to college last week. I thought I would be sad when he goes. Instead, i feel nothing. Also, i don't feel interested in anything. I'm not interested in work, or food, or anything really. Past 4 days, I have been doom scrolling, and playing games instead of working. I'm just not getting the motivation.

Has anyone else felt like that?","You’re describing symptoms of depression. I've dropped 3 off at college. The first one, I was the classic weepy mom. The 2nd one, I was exactly what you're describing. Turns out, I was depressed. I thought because I'd been through it already, I was OK with everything. I wasn't. As our kids leave home, they take a piece of us with them. You are probably in denial. I would highly recommend going to see a therapist if you dont resume your normal life in the next week to 10 days. Your 10 yo needs you in a good place mentally."
"Feeling sad about taking my daughter out of full time daycare
So my daughter has been in the same daycare since she was 2 years old, she absolutely loves her daycare, it is like her home away from home, she loves her friends, her teachers, and everything about the place.  Because she will be starting first grade next week and will be using her daycares before and afterschool program we will no longer qualify for subsidy which means our daycare bill is going from $326 per month to $800 per month with less hours even being at the daycare.  We have made the extremely difficult decision to put her in daycare only 2 days per week and my husband will alter his work schedule on the other days in order to take her to school and pick her up.   I told her about this plan last night and she was really upset, she said she wanted to stay in daycare and didn't want her dad to pick her up.  I'm feeling badly because at daycare she gets to play with her friends but at home she will likely just watch her iPad or watch TV.  I spoke with my husband about putting her in Monday, Wednesday and Friday as Friday they only go to school half day but he got annoyed and said there was no way he was going to pay for a day of daycare when he can pick her up from school.  Anybody else in the same boat.  I'm honestly just looking for reassurance that everything will be okay and that my daughter will still have friends and still be happy,  I just hate taking something away from her that she absolutely loves.    My husband thinks once school starts she will appreciate him picking her up and being able to go home 3 days per week and that she's just sad because daycare during the summer holidays is fun, they do fun things like go to the park, go for slushies, take field trips etc., I hope he's right...","My kids have always gone to daycare, but even in my son who goes to full time kindergarten, he is TOAST after a school day. He gets so much interaction and direction and rule-following throughout the school day that I’m happy to give him the reprieve at home to be a vegetable and decompress for an hour or two before we kick off evening activities. Especially if extracurriculars start for your kid, that relaxation time at home may be necessary, if not just desired. 

Embrace it! Post up next to her on the couch and just be there. It could mentally be just what she needs. If she’s being picked up and brought home to be babysat by the ipad, then you don’t actually have childcare. If your husband can’t engage with her after school then I would look at how you can actually provide care for her."
"My 17 years old daughter wants to date a same age boy
My 17 years old daughter wants to date a same age boy who approached her 2 weeks ago on Instagram. He claimed to be a friend of my daughter's female friend.

They already met 3-4 times in public places like shopping malls. And they have been on their phone everyday since he approached her.

My daughter said she would want to go his house to meet his dad. And she would want to go his house to study together.

I felt not right and said to her today that they could meet together in public places, but not isolated places like home, in a car where people not around.

To experienced fathers with adult daughter/or daughters,

What do you think on what is happening with my daughter?

How far would you allow your 17 years old daughter in these circumstances?","Is this an age thing or because you don’t trust the boy specifically? Because in less than a year she’ll be an adult and banning her from seeing men in non-public places won’t be viable. It isn’t now either, frankly. As someone who has been a 17 year old girl in that situation, if you start controlling her she might start hiding things from you. I think let her go to his house, make sure you know the address, tell her that she can call you anytime to get picked up. 

It's great that she's already so open with you about her plans and the boy, so keep the trust and those conversations open! I know it's scary because it's your little girl, but this is part of growing up. She'll be a voting adult next year!!"
"Sahm hate from women
Not that I think it matters but I’m 39 and my kids are 2&4. 

We just moved to a new place (in the Midwest USA) and I’m starting to meet other parents in the neighborhood at our local park. My children and I are there on weekdays during the workday if it makes a difference. 

Why is it when I tell other moms I’m a stay at home mom that I get snarky responses? The conversation always starts off nice but takes a very hard shift as soon as they find out I don’t have “real” job. Like, the words alone are not mean but the tone and even eye rolling is just hateful! Saying “ oh that must be nice” while your voice drips with venom and you roll your eyes so far it has to hurt is a conversation ender, so much for a nice chat with a potential new friend I guess… 

Why ask me what I do for work if you’re just going to be a butt when I say I stay home with my children? I’m really getting tired of this and about to start snapping back with a snarky comment of my own 

In the flip side I have not had any negative reactions from men when I tell them I’m a sahm.",I would never be snarky to a SAHM unless they started saying the whole “oh I could just never let strangers raise my kids.” At that point yes I’ll be snarky af The only time I’ve ever rolled my eyes at a SAHM was when she was:
"I have adult children and this is what I learned
I have three adult children in their 20s. I raised them on my own, with the youngest being 3 and the oldest 7, when they saw their dad for the last time. Their dad was a coke and heroin addict, and it took me a few years to leave—everything you’d imagine came with it, from financial ruin to domestic violence. The moment my ex turned on the children, I left.

Anyway, I had no family to turn to, nothing. We were homeless at times, we moved a lot, even countries, and even stayed on trails in tents, trying to hide, because my ex was trying to find and hurt us. But over time, though, we started healing. I went to therapy, focused on raising the kids, trying to make a living, and keeping us at least somewhat afloat. We all worked hard. My kids worked for a few dollars anywhere they could so we could buy food or pay the electricity bill. Meanwhile, they went to school and studied. I went to every school event I possibly could, cheered them on in any way I could, and tried to find solutions for anything they wanted to do that we couldn’t afford or didn’t have the means for. Above all, my routine with them stayed consistent; for example, every evening after homework, we ate dinner together, and I read them a bedtime story when they were little, or we went to the local libraries every Saturday, stuff like that, no matter where we were and how bad it was. 

Fast forward to today: I just hung up the phone with my oldest. He works in a job he loves and moved in with a sweet girlfriend who cooks for him daily—his biggest worry right now is the resulting weight gain. My other son just finished his master’s and is job hunting in a new city with his girlfriend, calling me for advice on job interviews and fashion choices. And my daughter—she’s finishing her doctorate, takes care of four pets, visits me daily because she lives close by, and is basically like my best friend.

The reason I’m writing all this is not just because I’m obviously immensely proud. No, it’s because I realized that all my children are kind, caring, educated, hardworking adults. I was so scared when they were growing up, because I had nothing, at times not even running water or a roof over our heads. But I marched on. I made sure they knew how to be consistent, ambitious, and hardworking. It wasn’t that I sent them to special schools, or that they had some incredible coach or life-changing experience. No, they were just kids who knew what my expectations were, and they also knew I was proud of them, supported them, and would go through fire for them if needed. Somehow, that seemed to be the most important thing.

I’m not saying that providing all the other things parents (myself included) worry about aren’t important. But I want every worried parent out there to know: you don’t need to be perfect—you just need to *be there*. At times, all I had to give was simply *being there*. But that seems to have been enough to raise adults with both drive and empathy.

Wishing you all a good night, y'all are doing great <3","When I had my first kid, and I was stressing about one decision or the other about what was best, I remember an older coworker I looked up to said to me “just love them.” At the time I didn’t think it was such a groundbreaking thing but I think it really is. Just love them. Do your best but it’s make or break we don’t have to absolutely agonize over where they go to preK or what sports to put them in. Just love them. Wow! Thanks for sharing. 🥲"
"13 yo step son tripped my 2 year old
Family were sitting in the lounge, my partner and 3 of her kids were sitting around playing uno, including the 13yo. My 2 year old had found his iPad and was playing on it. 

After a few minutes, the 13 year old came over and asked for his iPad. The 2 year old being cheeky said no and turned to run. That's when the 13 year old stuck his foot out and tripped him up. My 2 year old had the iPad in his hand, and at 2 is already uncoordinated. There was never a chance for him to try to save himself. He fell flat on his face on the iPad. 

Thankfully, nothing serious happened to him, but he obviously had a full break down, and I quickly whipped my head around to the 13yo with a what the hell do you think you are doing. He just looked at me with a what face as if he did nothing. Mom didn't say much in the scenario, which really threw me too for a wobbler. 

I get trying to keep the peace, but the kid is 13, and my son is 2. Tripping him was never a go-to in my mind, and so much worse could have happened, especially with an ipad at face level. 

I'm just trying to figure out where I go from here as a step parent on the best course of action so I can try resolve the entire situation so it doesnt happen again and the 13yo understand the severity of what his sctions could have led to be it a 2 year old otr older person and so my 2 year old , 1 isn't put in harms way and, 2 doesnt learn thay this is an okay habit to do. 

Just to add, I understand my son was in the wrong for running off with something that is not his, but he is only 2 and is very much in the everything is MINE stage. 

Edit: fixed my spelling mistakes 

Just for clarification. The 13 year old is my step son and the son of my partner. My 2 year old is my son with my partner.","Does the 13yo know that he has a right to forcibly remove any of his possessions from the toddler's hands or ask for you to do it and have it done immediately instead of chasing and then coaxing your kid to give back what he took? While your stepson was acting 100% wrong and did not think about the potential consequences, you and his mom need to give him the proper tools of resolving of the toddler-related issues (you may think he knows them, but it won't hurt to voice them out loud, especially if your and your wife's visions here differ). I mean, this seems like normal sibling stuff?"
"bullying/possible harassment.
I need some advice, please! 
My oldest son is twelve, and for the last month or so a boy who he used to be friends with (I stopped allowing them to hang out because of the other boys behavior) has been harassing my son. (The other boy is 13) Not only at school, but when he’s out in the neighborhood going to other friend’s houses. He’s texted my phone saying horrible things about my son to me. It’s also going on at school, he’s told my son to k!!l himself and threatened him with physical violence both in and outside of school. The school has seemed to do a good job of handling it. 
I’ve informed his mom of his behaviors and she assured me it would be taken care of, yet they’re still continuing. 
And I understand boys will be boys, they’ll bicker and fight, friendships end, etc..
But this is more than that. 
My son is sacred to go outside and is a nervous wreck every morning before school. 
My son has been in therapy for about a year now and takes an antidepressant.

Would I be going too far to contact the police? Even if there were no legal consequences would they at least speak to him (or mom) about what he’s doing and how it could lead to trouble with them? 
I just want this to stop, and his mom doesn’t seem to actually care about the issue and I don’t want my son being scared and anxious like he is.","This isn't possible harassment... this IS harassment. Ensure that you have everything that this kid has sent you saved on your phone, and honestly, go to the police. You gave the kids grownups a chance to resolve the situation and they haven't. Your son needs you to protect him outside of school too at this point. Even if the police can't do anything YET, if they have this on file then if something more happens, or an escalation happens, they will already have this information. And maybe they CAN do something. I'm not sure the laws where you are, but the messaging, the following him outside, all sounds like stalking to me.

This is an aside, but this rubbed me the wrong way... ""boys will be boys"". Do NOT use that to excuse a boys behaviour. Boys AND girls should be held to the same standard of behaviour. Boys aren't inherently rougher than girls just as girls aren't inherently ""softer"" than boys. Boys will be boys is a lame excuse society uses to excuse poor behaviour from boys, then we wonder why they turn into violent adults. Did you share with the other parent the k*ll yourself comments? That would be my last straw. You are not overreacting by reaching out to police if parents have already been given their courtesy. I’m sorry you are all dealing this."
"Play ideas for children who like to sort
My daughter’s most common type of playing is sorting or arranging toys that are not meant for that. Crayons, books, puzzle pieces, clothes, shoes, etc. she will arrange them into “tracks” or rows or circles. Does anyone have any ideas on specific toys or activities that would be more appropriate for this type of play?

"Wandered off School Grounds
My 5yo is in a paid after school care program that is located at his school. We’re in week 3. 

A mom of a kid in his class texted me(about 40 mins ago) that my son was alone, outside of the gated area surrounding the school in the parking lot. She called me and said she noticed him from far away but then was also noticing he didn’t seem to have anyone with him so she watched him for a minute. When he started walking towards the road/heading home she called out to him when she realized he wasn’t with anyone and was preparing to wander off even further.

She flagged a teacher and they immediately ushered him back in.

I showed up as I was still on the phone with the other mom so pretty much right after it happened. His teachers all said nothing as I signed him out so I asked about it and another woman came over to talk to me. She was very apologetic and said he must have slipped away during transition time, they’re going to retrain and do a thorough review, etc..

I am sort of in shock still and am digesting. That could have gone way differently if his classmates’ mom wasn’t there at the right time. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting. Getting it off my chest I guess. If anyone has any advice on how I should handle this please suggest. I trust them to keep my son safe and I’m shaking with rage/fear/relief/all the emotions right now. I’m a people pleaser and am way too nice to everyone but I feel like I can’t just let them apologize here? Do I just trust them and move on? I’m going to be so anxious about this now.

I talked to my son about making sure he doesn’t wander from the group and the teachers are there to keep him safe, etc.. he’s been in various camps and programs and has never done anything like that. I reinforced that I wasn’t mad at him but it is a rule at school to stay with the group and explained why it’s unsafe to wander.","Not sure where you're located, but in my state, they would be required to report that incident to licensing. You can report it yourself. It will likely trigger an additional inspection. But if they weren't taking it seriously, they will after that. Oh hell no.  Report this to licensing, this is crazy.  They should have self reported but yeah right.

I'm so glad he's okay."
"Men in my family keep eating food from my child's plate
Wondering if this happens in other families or is it just mine? Pretty much since my son started eating regular food, people in the family (and pretty much exclusively men - his dad and both male grandparents) will just help themselves to the food on his plate, regardless of if he's finished or not. My son is now 4 and has gotten very upset about this at times, he's even cried about it in the past when someone has finished his food that he still wanted. He recently announced ""New family rule! No one is allowed to eat food off my plate"". I backed him 100% as this really bugs me.

Last night we were out for an early dinner for my partner's birthday with his parents. I ordered my son's meal first so it arrived first, and there were fries on the side of his plate. Pretty much the second it gets put down, his grandad (my FIL) started helping himself to the fries. He didn't ask, he just started eating. I noticed my son was quiet, so even though it was awkward, I mentioned to the table, hey, we have a new family rule that no one can eat food from my son's plate unless he says it's ok. Then grandad proceeds to start tricking my son by getting him to turn around and distracting him so he can keep eating his fries. My partner was also eating them. By the time everyone else's food arrived, my kid was left with barely any fries on his plate. It's my in-laws so I didn't say anything further about it, but I don't understand why it was so hard to just not eat the child's food. 

Is this normal?!?!? Or just something in my family? I would not enjoy it if my plate were treated like a family share plate with people sticking their hands in and helping themselves - surely a child should be afforded the same respect? I mentioned this to my mum and she said my grandad did this to us too when we were little, he always had to taste everything we were eating, and she HATED it.","If they won't listen, I would silently take an amount off their plate and put in on your son's once their food arrives. I'm infuriated on your behalf. Surprised to see so many opinions in this thread leaning towards acceptable/sometimes OK.

A child said they're not happy with the behaviour, and grown-ups completely ignored that? Outrageous. This is now not a question of whether it's ok to take a couple of chips, this is now a question of whether it's ok for family to completely overrule your child's (very reasonable) request...and IMO it's 100% not ok.

Options:

Seat your child away from thieves

Publicly call out the behaviour so your child knows you have their back

Stop going out for dinner with thieves

Make the thieves pay for an extra portion

Take food from their plates to replace what was stolen"
"Is this the right thing to allow my 6th grader to organize?
This is uncharted territory as my 6th grader is my oldest. Anyway he just came to me after school and informed me that he and 2 other boys decided to organize a special snack time on Fridays. 

They do snack time mon-fri but usually the students pack in their own snacks or if they forget there's always a classroom snack option that parents all pitch in together. 

Our boys want to do something special on Fridays though as it's a half day and they combine their snack time with tea time. 

My son came up to me with an idea he wanted to do for his class and even said he would rather do this than our traditional junk food Friday. He wants to organize with these two boys so they can set the weekly ""menu"" for what special snack it will be and inform the kids in the class by like Tuesday,  however; my son said he's only going to invite the classmates to share the extra special snack if they weren't caught slipping up and bullying others. (This school has a major bullying problem) 

I am encouraging of this idea because it's going to encourage the kids to be kind to one another, the 3 boys setting this up are showing their ability to be independent thinkers as well as holding their peers accountable, and my son even expressed that he feels so much better when he can organize things like this and accomplish them without teachers help. 

I told my son I'll happily create the menus and relay them to the other mamas but the boys need to be responsible.

They need to report to mamas by Tuesday on what snacks they want (think homemade chips and guacamole, hot cocoa and croissant, kimpbap, etc) they need to let their peers know what the menu will be and hold themselves accountable. 

If my child has a particularly bad week at school and is fighting with peers or teachers he will still be expected to bring the class snack but he will have to eat a separate snack. 

Am I opening a can of worms here?","I can think of a couple reasons why a teacher would not really want to make this a thing. Have you spoken to them?

ETA my concerns: 

Personally (and if I'm misunderstanding how your son intends for this to work, please feel free to clarify, but this is how it reads to me) I really do not like the idea that your son and his chosen two friends get to decide who is invited to this special snack of their choosing. It is not their job to police and play judge over their peers. If the intention is actually for the TEACHER to decide, that may not be something they want to take on.
 
For another, public shaming is rarely an effective tool to change behavior. Rather than making a point to exclude those who misbehave, why not come up with a positive reinforcement system that rewards those who do well, without obviously shaming those who maybe just had a bad day or week? “Hey moms, we need 24 homemade croissants by Friday” lol I’m sure they’re all going to LOVE that. 

Why does your son have the authority to police who gets invited and who doesn’t? Don’t you see that is a massive recipe for disaster?"
"My 6 year old has been obsessing over having a little sibling...
My 6 year old daughter has been obsessing for a long time about wanting me to have another child, so much that she asks at least once a month for a baby brother or sister. 

I've explained to her numerous times that I'm not having anymore babies, and I can't (tubes tied). 

She talks to family about it all the time too, one of which is my oldest niece who's 21 and been around my daughter since she was born. 

Occasionally I'll ask the 21 year old to watch my kids (she's usually paid for it). 

On Monday the 21 year old was helping to keep an eye on my kids while my husband and I were moving his mom (all of the kids' Grandma) because her husband recently passed away and with his passing my MIL is moving in with her daughter (the mom of the 21 year old and 2 other children). 

Yesterday when I was putting my 6 year old to bed she told me that my 21 year old told her that the reason why I won't have another baby is we think she would hurt/unalive the baby. 

The 21 year old is known for saying out of pocket things at times to try and get a reaction out of my kids, but this one is has me going wtf. 

I called my husband and told him he called his mom, but the 21 year old is denying it and someone tried shifting blame on to my kid saying maybe she said it to try and get out of going to bed. 

My daughter has never said anything like that to try and get out of going to bed, which I feel like is the 21 year old deflecting. 

My daughter says out of pocket things a lot but never something like that. It's the typical 6 year old out of pocket stuff. 

I told my husband for the time being the kids don't need to be at his mom's house while we are moving her and if we can't have someone watching them at our house like my mom while we are moving his mom the kids and I will stay home, and once school starts I'll go up and move things on my own. 

How would you handle that situation? Even my husband said my daughter sounded sincere and truthful when I had her repeat it to him on the phone what she told me. 

I'm so livid right now because my daughter looked up to her cousins as like older sisters and I'm very heart broken for her, because the 21 year old was someone we thought we could trust with her.","[removed] I agree with your decision, 21-year-old has created a reputation for themselves and this is the consequence."
"ISR Swim Lessons… woah?!
Alright so my son (17 months next week) has been in regular swim lessons since April. He isn’t able to float on his own but is practicing with repetition how to swim to the wall. 

Our instructor let us know that she would be taking October to March off (we live in Florida but I guess winter months) so I thought to look around and find an instructor that was open year round.

I found one.

And I need some advice. Before going to this new instructor this morning, I had no idea about ISR swimming or what it was. With my son’s current teacher, she is using toys lined up against the side of the pool for him to swim too and he enjoys it. 

Today we rolled in to the new instructors home and we spoke a little before she told me she was ready to start.

WHAT IN THE WHAT?!?

I understand the importance of swim. I do, and I understand the statistics with drowning in children… but holy guacamole I was not prepared for what took place. (Neither was my son!!!) 

She had no toys in the pool (completely fine with me but obv he’s not used to that) and she was allowing him to sink then bringing him up and down then twirling then swimming to the wall (with very very little assistance) 
I’m not gonna lie, I cried. I friggin cried because his crying was making me so sad that I wasn’t saving him… (but am I teaching him survival skills so in a round about way, I am saving him sort of) ?? Trying to justify this morning.

The woman told me she would have him knowing how to survive a fall in 6 weeks. She’s done this for 35 years and I need to rethink my anxiety because this is a survival skill he needs.



Um.. am I being dramatic? Please share positives or negatives with ISR","ISR is a very specific kind of swim instruction-the entire point is surviving in the water. It’s not supposed to be fun, unfortunately. It’s controversial because it does involve serious discomfort (lots of swallowing water). But, the outcome is a child that won’t drown. Is the potential trauma worth it? Only you can decide that. ISR isn't for fun. It's for water survival."
"I’m scared I will have memory problems again when baby is born. Please give me advice.
I am pregnant with my third. My last baby, I would completely forget waking up at night. I’m not joking I was completely blacked out. I did not plan on cosleeping, but I’d wake up and my daughter would be in my bed and I hadn’t remembered putting her there. It was very scary for me. I felt like if I’m that out of it I wouldn’t know and lay on top of my daughter. 
I’m so terrified of it happening again. And now my two toddlers wake up in the middle of the night and get in my bed. The bed is crowded and I’m scared I want remember and put the baby in bed and someone will lay on top of them.","Where is your partner in all of this? Have you seen the cribs anchored to the main bed as a co-sleeper?

NOT THIS BRAND, this was just a website that shows the type and setup- https://www.babybay.us/bedside-sleepers-co-sleeping/?srsltid=AfmBOopeo5Akcy4vsXFEPU7in3AWmBhRxvfZ8beJCfQTKXlsTnDzF44_


Something like this will help you. It stops you from rolling into the baby but keeps them close enough to hold/feed. Also keeps the toddlers out of it.

Next, divide your bed into “mom only” space, right next to the baby, and “toddler space”. They can only sleep on the side of the bed where baby is not, and put a pool noodle or pillow as the dividing line."
"My kids hate my wife out of nowhere.
Hello all, 

So I (38m) got married last year to my wife (39F) after a couple years of dating. I came with children, (now aged 11m and 13f) and immediately they hit it off with my girlfriend/fiancé/wife. I used to joke that of my kids two parents, their favorite one was my girlfriend. Cuddles watching movies, lil’ shopping trips, you name it. I am a 3 day a week parent, and the rest of the week they’re with their mother. 

A little backstory, I am 4+ years sober and my wife has been sober since about two months before we met. My ex was (I think still is, no proof though) a very big drinker and almost lost custody to me last year. I used to be regaled of stories of her terrible boyfriend and her drinking every weekend.

A couple months ago, my daughter was in a depressive state and my wife sat her down and had a heart to heart. Something along the lines of “you’re not helping yourself doing nothing in your room, being lazy and unmotivated” and that completely put my daughter off of her completely. No more shopping trips or hair dying or anything. Basically no contact. I get what my wife was trying to say, and feel like she gave some hard advice that was not received well. 

Similarly, my son was being “playful sassy” (his words) and backed talked my wife along the lines of “your grounded missy, go to your room” and the way he said it was not playful nor was it taken as such. My wife responded saying not to speak to her that way, which again, I completely understand. Now he has given her the cold shoulder. 

Both kids basically refuse any contact with her and refuse to come to my house. I’m at my wits end trying to reunify my house and I feel like I’m fucked no matter what I do. Any advice would be completely welcomed","Yeah, calling someone who is depressed  lazy will do that. Your kids sound like they need mental health support (their childhoods must have been very hard). Your wife sounds like she needs to learn their behaviour is communication, and ro respond with compassion. You need to step up and help your kids and not leave this role to your new wife. Your wife overstepped, particularly with the daughter, in a big way, and with terrible and hurtful advice no less. I mean, this is a 13 yo girl with a tough childhood, not a peer in rehab. 

She was the fun adult, not a parent. It would be hard enough to to bridge from that into parenting anyway, especially as they had two parents already and still living. 

She may also have been a safe space for both kids, given that the mother drinks a lot and you used to drink a lot. I mean, your ex almost lost custody. She doesn’t have the baggage that you and your ex have, and she was kind and fun and understanding.

And then she, a trusted adult, kicked your daughter in the gut when she was at her lowest. The things that you refer to her talking about are classic symptoms of depression, not personal failings.  And you can’t really treat depression by pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, especially given all the turmoil she’s had in her life on top of being a 13yo girl. It depends on the cause of the depressive episode and how bad it is. I mean, these sudden changes in behavior can flag some serious shit, like bullying or even sexual assault. So what’s happened is that your wife’s not trusted anymore. I get it. I wouldn’t trust her either.

You say you get what she was trying to do, but you don’t really show any of the same empathy for your daughter. That’s really disturbing to me.

My guess is that this is part of what the boy was reacting to, and yes, he shouldn’t be disrespectful to your wife. But he’s in this chaotic environment and now his sister is falling apart and he’s seeing a new side of an adult he thought was solid. I get that too. It’s normal for a kid his age to be lashing out in this situation, and often kids push the hardest with those they feel the safest with. Your wife absolutely shouldn’t allow disrespect, but she also needs some empathy and she needs to leave parenting and discipline to you.

You may be able to fix some of this OVER TIME with patience and sincere apology to the daughter and actually listening to them. Family therapy, if they want it, may help if you and your wife are serious about doing it the right way, or individual therapy for the kids if you aren’t. Or either way. It sounds like they could use it. With a serious, secular, experienced therapist.

But yeah, your wife fucked up and honestly you don’t seem to be doing much better."
"At what point did anyone switch to lullabies vs white noise at naps?
One day I decided to play a twinkle twinkle little star lullaby on our Alexa for my son (21mo) as I was getting him down for a nap. He fell asleep so I asked her to play our brown noise like usual. I’ve just done it again, but wondering if anyone does the same but leaves the lullabies playing the full nap? I have to have something playing for him as my work desk is just outside the door, we have dogs, and I’d rather his nap not end early because of the dogs barking or my meetings, but I would like to cut back on the brown noise at some point.","heh this sounds great until the Alexa lullaby playlist runs out and switches to like the lion king soundtrack or something

"Advice for almost 3YO who wakes up 5-6 times a night
My daughter turns 3 in a couple days and has always been a really good sleeper. Since ~6 months she was sleeping in her own room for ~11 hours a night and rarely would we need to go in. Usually only for sickness. She's had some sleep regressions (most notably at ~18 months she'd wake up at 4:30-5 every day for a month or so) but it's all been manageable until now.


A month or two ago we turned her crib into a toddler bed (same frame but removed bars on one side so she can get in and out). This generally hasn't been a problem, and initially she slept better in the toddler bed than the crib because when she'd wake up in the morning she'd go play with toys in her room rather than yell at us to get her, Then, her ""time to wake"" clock would turn green and she'd ask for us.


This all changed about two weeks ago. It started with her wanting the door open at night. Her room is at the top of the stairs, and our room is downstairs, AND we have really annoying cats. We tried telling her we can't keep the door open or else the cats will wake her up (which has happened in the past and she hates), but closing the door was instant tantrum to the point where she almost threw up. So, we relented and kept the door open at night, then closed it after a couple hours when she was asleep. We told her if she got out of bed we'd have to close the door, which she respected. This was fine for about a week.


HOWEVER, now when she does her mini-wakeups at night she will SCREAM that she wants mommy and daddy until we go check on her. We ended up just leaving the door open which helped for a night or two (although she'd wake up an hour earlier than normal due to the cats), but now even with the door open she will scream for us 8-9 times a night. We are all exhausted. My work is suffering. My spouse's work is suffering. I think my child is close to getting kicked out of daycare due to how miserable she's been there the past week due to being so tired (throwing her snack, not listening to teachers, throwing massive tantrums if she has to do something she wants to do, etc).


What can we do? We suspect this stems from anxiety thanks to my genes. We've tried:

* Night light
* Sleeping on a mattress outside her door
* Staying in her room while she falls asleep
* Letting her pick out a special new blanket and pillow
* Moving white noise machine closer to the door and turning it up a little
* Letting her keep her Yoto mini in her bed so she can listen to it

Nothing works. She is still up almost every hour from 10pm-7am. We are close to just saying fuck it and putting a mattress in her room and one of us sleeping with her at night. We REALLY don't want to do this because we desperately need solo/duo decompression time at night and we don't to be stuck sleeping in her room for months/years. But, I don't know what else to try at this point. Anyone go through something similar and have some pointers?

It's worth noting that she still naps, 1.5-2 hours ~1-3pm. I really don't want to drop her nap because she clearly needs it still (she's rubbing her eyes constantly since this all started, and occasionally says she's sleepy), and also daycare legally has to give every kid the opportunity to nap, and because (traditionally) my daughter has loved sleep, she'll always opt for the nap.","[removed] Has anything unusual happened recently in your lives? What could seem small to you might be big to her, and this might be a reaction to that."
"Never had the 'village', found it with community
We moved across country when 7 months pregnant to be close to my partners family. I was a foster child, so did not have close blood relatives to give, but from a large city. Partners family in small town was very uninvilved,
 never tried to be apart of anything

Moved back to my large city when daughter was 2 1/2 years old. Since then, she's been enrolled in Preschool, and we have found great friends at her school and local community center. 
We have playdates 3 times a week, sometimes the whole 
 group, sometimes one on one. My daughter has found a grandma who is not blood related, but she is her grandma in heart.  

I am not the most social person, so it took a lot of work, but we got to the point, I have many other mothers I can call on for baby sitting on in case of emergency. I am so grateful. it's had to not have the built in village, but look and hopefully you will find them.","My best friend is my number one in my village 😊 /u/sexysweetcadavr, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"At a loss with my 2yr daughters sudden sleep changes, looking for similar experiences?
My daughter has always been an amazing sleeper, by 3 months she was sleeping in 7-8 hours chunks at night and has continued to sleep very well at night. Sleep regressions around her milestones have always affected her naps instead of her nighttime sleep, but this seems to be the longest ""regression"" I've seen her have and I just don't know what to do. She just turned 2 last month and id say we are going on 3 weeks of her not napping. Her sleep has looked sort of like this:
Wakes up at 5:30am, falls back asleep 45 minutes later and stays asleep until 8/8:30am, i attempt to put her down for a nap at 1pm and she stays awake in her crib for about an hour.
 Then as a result she has meltdowns at 4pm on the dot from being overtired, and is passed out a minute after being put in her crib at 6pm.
Before this regression started she was waking up at 7am, having her nap at 12:30pm and sleeping until 2/2:30pm and her bedtime was 7:15pm. Life was good!!! Minimal tantrums or none to be found.
Now I just don't know what to do, i know most 2 year kids still need their nap and aren't ready to drop one but this is the longest we've gone like this. I miss her schedule and I miss her happy go lucky self!!
Any advice? Did your 2 year old go through something similar? Tell me it won't last much longer 😅
(I also want to point out it's very clear how much she's been learning from this regression the past few weeks, her vocabulary and speech has gone crazy!)

"SO nervous about first grade
I don’t know exactly what it is but I am so nervous about my daughter starting first grade tomorrow. She has no clue, totally hyping her up and easing her worries buttt I thought because kindergarten was a breeze I’d be dealing fine. I just worry about her being able to find the lunchroom, her ability to use a restroom not in the classroom the way kinder was, the bigger kids on the playground. Ability to focus for a full day vs half the day. Ughhhh. She’s starting a new school this year and so it’s all just very new. Can any experienced parents help easy my mind 🥲","Hey /u/Altruistic-Banana825! It looks like you might be new here.

"How to deal with kid's disappointment with ""living"" situation?
My son is actually quite disappointed or possibly angry at me. He's like ""why can't I go to Disneyland, have a pool, go on trips to Asia"" etc. ""My best friend has been to China once and has been to Disneyland Twice already"".

I say ""No"" to a lot of these things because we simply can't afford it. Yeah he has a roof over his head, but he can't have those experiences yet per se (honestly mainly due to money).

How would you actually deal with this? H*e has a safe home, he has food on the table every day.*

Like I'm not gonna go into a debt trap so he can have plane trips or go to Disneyland. **That is actually even MORE financially irresponsible.**","I just tell my kids that those things cost a lot of money and we can't afford it. Then ask them to help come up with things you can do instead. We can go to the pool at the Y, we can plan a vacation to x, we can go to y. My kids are younger, but if they continue to throw a fit about not getting what they want, I ask if they are behaving like children who get to do fun things like take trips.


You don't need to feel guilty about not taking your kid to Disney. That is a luxury not a necessity. He knows you feel guilty, which tells him that you should be doing it. He is old enough to understand that you're not rich and have to met financial obligations before luxuries. A lot of parents deals with this. Even rich parents, because depending on who one compares oneself to, things will never be good enough. 

You  are being financially responsible and making sure your kid has what he needs. You can’t save him from all disappointments coming from the world being utterly unfair. Those disappointments are there and something a lot of us have to go through. You can try to make something productive out of it, like how can you make your vacations better even if they can’t be expensive. How can he help kids with even less money also have a good vacation? Teach him that when life gives you lemons you make limonade."
"Teacher rant
Throwing this in for context: my son is the middle child and is speech-delayed but getting help for it. He only says a few words.

This morning dropping off my  3.5 year old at preschool, which by the way is his THIRD day of ever being in a school setting in his little life, the teacher grabbed my son before I had a chance to hug him and said “you’re fine! You’re a big boy!” 

Then she let a teacher aide bring my son into the classroom while she hugged another crying kid and comforted him. (?!)

This really bothered me because I don’t use such dismissive language at home. Calling a 3 year old imho a “big boy” is dismissive, negates their feelings and is expecting the child to behave in ways in which they are not developmentally ready. It’s ok to feel sad and it’s ok to miss your mom on the THIRD day of school. 

Am I overthinking things? Am I the one that’s being too sensitive? Should I let it go? I understand being a preschool teacher isn’t easy, but the way she talked to my son really rubbed me the wrong way. My son just walked to the classroom crying and it broke my heart. What should I do? I don’t want her talking that way to my son, and I want to advocate for him, but I also don’t want her to dislike me and treat my son differently if I bring it up to her.","I think it really depends on tone. Did she prevent the hug, or just grab him before it happened and she didn’t know? Was she trying to cheer him up, or saying it in a more matter of fact way?

I don’t really have an issue with “big boy” or “big girl.” I think you’re looking into it way further than any child would feel. But I agree he should be able to hug his mom before school. I hug my 7 and 8 year old before school.

I would have grabbed him back and say “he’s allowed to hug his mom” if I felt like she was trying to avoid me comforting him. you’re mostly overthinking. You can’t control how other ppl talk to your kid and they’re gonna use some language you don’t like. She might have also assumed you just gave him a hug in the hall."

I asked him if he would rather live with his dad, he says NO. I asked him if he doesn’t like his life, he says he loves it - yet, everyone sees what I see.

"Its Fall Sports Season...
My son loves soccer. As do his friends. Its their THING. The thread that bonds them. Well, his two best friends made the A team (U10, Grades 3/4) and my son didn't. Completely fair decision if Im being unbiased, but I've been bummed all day since rosters came out last night. He was obviously pretty sad, we watched a video and repeated one of catch phrases. ""We go again, and we work even harder"". The reality is he is quite skilled technically but he doesnt have the intrinsic motivation to make the A team. Certainly not now, maybe not ever. 

I feel bad he's going to miss the commraderie, the sleepovers and going out for ice cream after games. I worry his confidence will take another hit, when it already was wobbly at best. I worry he will see himself as ""less than"". I worry he'll never get a chance to have those experiences his best friends have. I worry he'll get left behind. 

Im hopeful this gives him an opportunity to step out of their shadow. Im hopeful he kicks on and finds other friends on the B team. Im hopeful he sees how good it feels to he successful and finds some motivation, not just in soccer but at working towards any goal in life. Im hopeful playing at the right level for him gives him all the coping skills and lessons we want sports to give.

"Bullying leading to my kid to get physical
My daughter is a kindergartener and she has been having issues at school.

It started last week on Monday, my daughter got into a physical fight with another student because they both ran into each other when getting their lunchboxes off the wall and started scuffling.

The principal told me she lost recess.

Then two days later , during lunch , there was a child crawling on the floor  under the lunch table and my daughter kicked this girl in the face.


Now today I get a call (she was having a fabulous week so far) the counselor tells me that a girl called my child ugly and my daughter decided to grab her by the hair and pull it, then stomping her feet.

Now she lunch recess again.

The last event I don’t think is that bad as my kid (IMO) was defending herself.

I feel mentally abusing (verbal abuse) on my child is gonna make her act out. She’s just a baby. So are the other kids but when is enough enough? She is my oldest , this is my first time. Please advice would be great.","Former teacher and all of the things happening to your child is pretty common in school situation and your child is overreacting. Bumping into someone means both apologize and try to watch better not a physical fight. Someone under the table should be ignored. Though name calling is not acceptable it also happens in any group
Setting and should not immediately lead to a physical confrontation. Has your child been in group settings before?  It seems she is taking offense to pretty common childhood social interactions. Minimum a meeting with teacher and principal to work out a strategy to help your child adjust to school.  A serious conversation with your child about not physically reacting any time someone does something your child takes as offensive is absolutely necessary .  Your child needs to learn self control and you do not seem to understand  your child is behaving inappropriately and the school is trying to work with your child, consequences for her actions could be more severe. You think an appropriate response to someone calling your kid a name is for your child to physically react and grab the kid by the hair? From all the instances described above your child's behaviour was not appropriate. Did she kick the kid under the table on purpose? You should teach your kid to tell others who misbehave toward them to stop and if they don't to walk away and/or seek help from the teacher."
"I need skills or resources to communicate with my 6 year old
My son is amazing and I love him more than anything but lately he has developed a pretty serious attitude at home. He talks back and argues with everything that I tell him and he tells me he does not have to listen to me and he can do whatever he wants. I have such a hard time explaining to him what my responsibilities are as a parent and how things need to be. I do not know how to understand what he’s going through or let him understand where I’m coming from. Whenever I try to give him a peptalk or talk to him calmly I just cannot find the words that I need to find and I just end up frustrated with myself. 

This issue isn’t exclusive to just dealing with my son, I struggle whenever I am having emotional conversations with my wife as well. I just cannot find the words that I need to explain how I’m feeling and honestly, I can’t even even explain these things to myself in my own head most of the time. I want to be able to communicate with him and I don’t want to say anything that I will regret later on.","I can't help with communication skills but honestly I think it's just practice consistently have fairly open (age appropriate of course) conversations about all sorts of things (not just when there are problems) and I would imagine that they will get easier. 

My kids have attitudes from time to time"
"Husband upset our daughter won't hug him
For the past few years, I have been the preferred parent for our daughter, now 3.5 years old. There was a time briefly when she would want her dad more, but it's mostly me. When both of us are around, she only wants to show affection to me (hugs, kisses etc) and will clearly and vehemently say to her daddy that she does not want to hug or kiss him, only mama. When it's just him around, she will be more affectionate with him.

My husband is clearly hurt that our daughter often says she doesn't want to hug him, and he gets angry at me when I acquiesce to her request for her hugs. He says I am enabling this continued bad behavior and favoritism. However, I absolutely do not want to force her to show affection to anyone if she doesn't want to. I believe she has a right to her bodily autonomy, and should never be forced to show affection. And I don't like the idea of not giving my daughter affection because she won't give affection to her dad. I also feel like that is teaching the wrong message to her.

How have you been dealing with children who are selective with their affection to their parents? I'm assuming this is a phase like anything and she'll grow out of it, but not until she's probably older.",She’s 3!  Now such thing as favoritism. This is 100% typical behavior and he really needs to get a grip. He should ignore her and start playing by himself with some toys. When she comes over to play along he should keep everything low key
"Dinner time
I’m just curious - do you sit at the table together to eat dinner? I’m starting to realize my family doesn’t really do this. I feel a bit guilt with my son going away to school soon.",Basically every night. We make exceptions on pizza nights/weekends and sometimes kids are at friends or whatever but for the most part we eat at the table together with no tech every night. I don’t get how people don’t really because if I’m going to make dinner then we’re going to eat it together It’s not too late to start. Even start Monday at the table or just a couple nights a week.
"Anyone else feel awkward talking to their baby in front of other people?
First, I talk to my baby like he’s a real person — I narrate our day, sing to him, do things to make him laugh and smile, etc. I was the same with our now four-year-old. However, I realized that when my in-laws visited recently, I essentially went quiet around him when they were nearby. They are extremely into the (very loud) baby talk around him, so much so that no else can even have another conversation in the same room because it’s so intense and they’re ultra-focused on him. As strange as it sounds, it almost feels like they’re intruding on my relationship with my baby and it feels too intimate for me to be fully comfortable displaying in front of them, and they kind of take over. Anyone else know what I mean? I don’t feel this way around my husband or mom. 

I realized this when my mother-in-law said I’ll have to “play some songs from my phone so I can learn some lullabies to sing”, as apparently from her vantage point, I’m essentially mute around my baby. I don’t know, I know this is a strange post, but it just feels awkward and now it’s bugging me. I’m sure they’re also now judging me which is a fun bonus.","I talk to my baby in public like he’s grown up all the time. Idc what people think. I have full blown conversations with him. Yeah I do. I get quiet around my in-laws too although I visited my family recently and really couldn’t care less and I talked to my baby as much as I pleased.

Your in-laws probably just make you feel awkward"
"Is there a polite way to do this?
Looking for some ideas from The hive mind here. 
My daughter is turning six and she wants to have her first birthday party with friends from school. 
Thing is, kids birthday parties are expensive. She also has everything she could ever want and does not need more 'things'. Is it appropriate to ask for a contribution towards cost in lieu of a gift and if so, what would be a nice way of doing this? 

Update: thank you all for the insight. This is exactly why I asked here- because I would have absolutely zero problem with a setup like this, but also know I'm pretty socially illiterate so the perspective of others is very appreciated 😊
It was never about our ability to afford the party, it was about other people's incistence often to bring something which is very much not needed- I thought that might be a way for people to feel like they were contributing without feeling compelled to buy more 'stuff'. Looks like we're just pushing on with the party as planned, and politely asking for no gifts (and hoping most people don't feel obliged to do it anyway- because while it's very appreciated, my house only has so much room 😂)","Don’t throw a party you can’t afford. The above is fine asking for a money gift and not contribution to the cost of the party. Now what you do with the money after is up to you but there is nothing wrong with just having a few friends and not the whole class. It’s hard is this because we all want to give our kids what they want but we can’t always afford it. And everything costs. Do what you can afford. If she really wants a big party get saving for next year. We call them fiver parties in Ireland. 
In invite put please no gifts but if you insist then 5$ in a card would be appreciated"
"Am I being unfair?
I have a 1.5m and a 3f. They are both at a grabby “mine” age and we’ve been battling it a lot. But also trying to teach sharing. Most of the time it’s just about not snatching. Tonight my son wanders into the garage to play in the swing chair. My daughter comes over with us and wants in too. I tell her not right now, her brother is using it. He plays some more then wants down and wanders back into the yard. My daughter calls me back asking for help with the chair so I go over, ask if she wants it outside, then bring it out. She climbs in then offers her brother a spot when wants up too. They swing shortly then both want it to themselves. I get my son down and explain his sister was in it first this time. He moves on to playing with bubbles. I get the good bubble wand and now of course my daughter wants it. I tell her no and they have to share and take turns. After him having several attempts with it, and continually dropping it in the bottle I get it out and ask if his sister can have a turn now. This creates uproar with him and she has snatched the wand. I’m trying to diffuse the situation and dad chimes in about how our daughter is acting and how my son is going to hate me if I do that kind of thing all the time.

I wasn’t going to make either kid give up the chair to take turns. But bubbles that he hasn’t quite grasped, after 10 tries I feel it’s fair to ask them to take turns. Am I being unreasonable or unfair towards my son?","Attempting to rationalize with a 1.5 year old is your problem.

Just say no and let her cry. I don't think you're being unfair, as long as there is a consistent rule. If she had been doing bubbles first and he wanted a turn, would you have enforced that?

Side note: purely for logistical ease, you may consider getting 2 of some popular smaller items (like bubble wands). But then, of course, they'll bicker over who gets which of the identical items..."
"1.5 yr old fights sleeptime
I feel like no matter what I do my son puts up a fight every single night before going to bed. Sometimes I get lucky & only have to deal with 10-20 minutes of pure yelling & screaming. Other nights it can take over an hour to put him to sleep & by the time he is sleep I’m sleep as well then I wake up in the middle of the night and go lay in my bed. It’s like bed time just can’t be relaxing for him & I’m at my wits end. I can’t help but to lose my patience it’s frustrating because I want bed time to be a relaxing moment I give him a bath every single night , we will read a few books , sometimes I let him play before bed, & once I turn the light off all hell breaks loose. If I try to comfort him he gets even more mad throwing himself around acting like someone is trying to murder him. It gets to the point to where I have no choice but to hold him in place until he calms down because he refuses to even just lay still. If I don’t hold his legs he will play with his feet all night or kick at the walls if he’s angry. Which is irritating because I want him to lay on his own not me forcing him to lay or him having to have a whole entire breakdown to tire himself out. Idk I guess I’m just venting . When does this get better ? I can’t keep up with the outburst & getting kicked at because he’s flopping all around going nuts . I’m also pregnant so idk if my patience is extra thin because of that but the stomach kicking is just beyond me. I even put sleepy time bubbles in the bath sometimes the soak salts , I just went and got some lotion & spray I feel like all of this shit is a scam. I don’t mind having to sit with him until he sleeps it’s just the build up that it takes for him to actually calm down and lay is annoying asf & then once he is calm laying down he’s usually just playing around with his toes or fingers. Idk I’m just annoyed. I hope this ends soon or I can at least get it under control before the baby gets here & I can’t even close his room door because the knob is broken so that also isn’t an option & even if it was I’m pretty sure my son has night vision because he literally will get up in the pitch black & find stuff to play with .…","Everyone’s experience is different but here’s what we do with my 19 mos son. 

Wind down starts at 6:30 PM. At 6:45 we start telling him it’s bath time and to find a book. My wife and I swap between bath duty and bed duty, so whomever is on bed duty starts laying out pajamas and all that, the other reads to him. 6:50 is bath time, usually takes about 5-10 minutes. By 7:10 he’s all lotioned up and in his pajamas. Bed time parent comes up with his night milk, sits with him while he drinks it, he usually downs it and passes out no later than 7:30. 

Also, my mother in law is our daytime child care. He’s ALWAYS doing something with her. My wife brings him home at 5, we eat then we usually take him to the playground or the mall to get the zoomies out. He’s pretty tired by 6pm. It's a phase but it might be a long one. He needs to learn to just go to sleep himself. Yes, the lotions and bath salts are a scam and won't do shit. Nix the playtime before bed too if it rules him up. 

You say he flips out as soon as the lights turn off. Maybe do story time with a dim night light and sit with him until he dozes. I assume he's out of a crib? Maybe put him back in one. Definitely fix the doorknob"
"Backtalk
My son is about to be 4 in October. He has been working through his emotions, I'm sure. But anytime I tell him/ask him to do something, I get ""Why?"" Over and over again.

I'm also hearing him say ""I don't like you."" Alot. And his newest onw he said was after he asked why, I told him ""because I said so and im your momma."" His reply "" you not my momma""

What. Do. I. Do. How do I get through this stage?","Hahahaha you don't get through to 4-year-olds.   
I have 2 boys so when we got stuck in a ""why"" roundabout I would ask them their opinion or a question. 

We need to clean up in here please   
""Why?""   
I think it's nice to live in a clean house, don't you?   
""No!""   
Okay, you start over there.   
""Why?""   
Are we going to start cleaning up over here, or are we going to clean in the same spot together? 

I found giving options rather than demands worked way better. It stops the ability to ask why if you begin with a question.   
As for the ""Ï don't like you""   
You know that that's not the truth, you know that he's exploring and navigating boundaries.   
My response in those moments was:   
""Okay! I still love you though!!! Lots and lots and lots!""   
Ignore the negative, encourage the positive. I don't think a 4 year old asking Why is ""backtalk"" at all.  Just explain why.  That's a very developmentally normal thing for him to do.  Better yet, tell him why right when you ask/tell him to do something.


I don't think I have ever once uttered the phrase ""because I said so"" in my 20+ years of parenting.  Honestly."
"Daughter ousted by friend group… she’s distraught I need advice
My daughter is 9, in the 4th grade. She’s had 2 close friends since the first grade let’s call them Ava and Chloe. This year just started and it’s been rough. It seems as though over summer Ava and Chloe have been hanging out a ton without my daughter and became really close. A new friend Beth, joined the group this year and has basically taken my daughter’s place in the friend group. My daughter is distraught. She has no explanation as to why this happened she said there was no fight or anything just things changed over summer… 

She says she has no one to sit with at lunch now and everyone already has their friend groups- that she has no where to fit in now 

My heart is broken for my girl. She does girls scouts with these girls and is now saying she does not even want to go to that anymore. Chloe is having a birthday party inviting only some girls and my daughter was not even invited! It’s so heartbreaking. Chloe seemed so nice and they played great together. 

What advice can I give my daughter in this situation? 

I’m not close with any of the moms, just friendly like hi how are you and small talk at pick ups etc. so I don’t feel comfortable confronting the parents about this, nor does my daughter seem to want me involved.

Do I encourage her to make new friends and just let things play out? Do I encourage her to have a talk with the girls to see what went wrong? Do I explain that these things sometimes just happen in life and there are friends for a reason, friends for a season and friends for a lifetime? I just don’t know what advice to give my girl and it’s hurting my mom heart.","If it were my kids, I would tell them a relatable story and the importance of having her own sense of self, the importance of being friendly outside of your “clique” and how sometimes being “a part of the group” isn’t the most important thing. At 9 she will definitely experience more of this type of behavior, and in hs if she isn’t involved she may see other people involved in catty behavior & it’s better for her to understand letting people who aren’t meant to be in your life go, not everything is exactly as it seems, find her forever people, etc This happened to my daughter, twice. Lots of tears. Lots of reflection. Lots of explaining that you can’t control other people and to try to find other friends. Heartbreak all around sadly, it was an awful awful few years. I probably tried to distract her a lot by doing fun things and having a lot of movie nights. 

She’s 16 now and quite attached to me, so I’m not sure I did the right thing there but I do encourage her to spend time with the few friends she does have. 

It’s such an awful thing to have to go through"
"Daughter crying everyday at summer camp?
My daughter is 6 years old and finished her first year of Kindergarten with before and after school care. She is going to grade 1 on Tuesday (Less than 1 week from today).

I sent her to summer camp with the same organization as she did her before/after care. It's almost daycare style in a building with a playground. She was doing OK in the summer camp, although never liked it and always dreaded going, but this last week she's been crying every morning, and I talked to her teachers and she won't play or speak with anyone. She's been faking issues to come home (and the staff have been calling me to pickup everytime). When I try to talk to her about it, she's very reluctant but basically says ""When I walk in, everyone looks at me and I don't like it"". She's always been shy/introverted, but has always made friends/ played with other kids, enjoyed her school.

I'm now worried what things are going to look like next week with going back to real school. From your experience, could it just be the summer camp/type of summer camp, or should I be more concerned about a larger issue? I've tried to talk to her about bullying, if she feels safe, etc but I'm not getting anywhere.

Any and all advice is welcome! I'm at a loss as to what to do.

  
EDIT  - I just wanted to add she's a good kid. She's likeable, respectful, kind to others, listens to the rules - she's just shy. She doesn't cause any problems and it's heart breaking to have her experiencing this.","If you don't have any concerns about how the camp is being run, then this sounds like it could be anxiety. I had a similar experience when my 8-year-old suddenly refused to wear his brand new shoes and was in tears over it. He wanted to wear his old shoes that had literal holes in them. I could see his socks and I ended up throwing them away. He insisted on wearing rain boots instead of his new shoes at that point. 

It took several weeks and the introduction of the topic with his therapist for him to say that they were coming unfastened easily, and when he refastened them, they made a noise and kids in his class would look at him. It freaked him out so much that he didn't want to wear them at all. I would highly encourage you to sign up for more variety of camps next Summer. I'm a teacher, and the students who complain the most about afterschool care and school holidays are the ones who never get to go anywhere else. But my students who go to afterschool care but go somewhere else for camp don't have the same negative associations and level of complaints."
"Am I jealous or is my reasoning valid?
Hi guys, 
Long story short, my partner has been in my life for a very long time just as friends and during my pregnancy (I was single). We have naturally became together and he’s helped raised my son since. 

It’s been 5 years since my son was born and my partners parents have also been in his life the whole time. 

They have a full blood related grandson who we will call Kai who is 4 years older than my son. I don’t know if it’s me being jealous but Everytime we go to my partners parents house, my son doesn’t get the same treatment as what Kai gets. Like example, there’s photos everywhere of Kai, when Kai is around 90% their attention goes on Kai and only 10% to my son. 

I don’t know where to add this part but I’ll add it here. I have heard my partners dad say to Kai infront of my son (my son was about 2 at this point). “I love you my only grand son” looks back at my son and says you could be a possible grandson. I can’t remember the exact words 


My son will literally stand there watching them looking really upset because they don’t really involve him in anything. All the toys there always have to be stated as Kai’s. If my son plays with one he gets a reminder please be careful they’re Kai’s toys, when my son looks around he comes to me up set because he says why is there only 1 photo of me and that’s with you and dad, the rest are all of Kai. 

They help Kai’s mum with school pick ups, go watch his sporting games and more. I was looking to enroll my son into swimming and maybe soccer when summer comes around and invite them but I can already assume they’d turn it down.. before it’s assumed no it’s not because Kai is enrolled, it’s because my son has shown high interest in these activities and we finally financially can afford it. 

Anything for Kai they will literally be there with in a drop of a hat. When it’s for my son my partner says maybe not because they don’t really go to these things. When in reality they do.. for Kai..

Now I don’t know if I would be entitled to speak with my partner about this because I know he doesn’t see what I see but on one hand my son is step grand son and Kai is full blooded but on the other hand they have known my son since he was born. It makes me want to stop taking my son over there as he does get heavily left out and not treated the same.","It sounds like the grandparents require a formal commitment to consider your son ""family"".  Marriage, or maybe formal adoption would do it.  

I can think of both good and bad reason to hold off.  Maybe they see the relationship as temporary and don't want to get attached to a kid they would have no rights to if you separated.  Maybe they feel that kids outside of marriage don't count, or that relationships aren't ""real"" without legal bonds.  But it seems that they are open to taking the relationship to the next level if you and your partner choose to do so. I know it's very cool to use the term partner, but are you actually married to this person? If not"

"Drop off on first day of preschool and beyond
Hi everyone!

My little is 20 months old and will be starting preschool tomorrow. He has never gone to daycare and up until now has been home with me and my husband since we work from home. He is VERY attached to me (cries when I go to the bathroom or get something from the garage). He is attached to my husband, but not in the same way. 

Anyway, we both really want to be there tomorrow to drop him off and see him off. However, I wonder if walking away from not only one, but both of us would be too hard for him. Should only one of us do it? I just can't imagine not seeing him off on his first day. Also, we can have the teachers get him from the lobby or we can walk him to the classroom. Which is better?

I know it may be a tough transition for the first couple of weeks. What would you recommend as the strategy of who takes him? Note, my dad is also an occasional option to help, but it will mainly be me and my husband. I really want this to be as smooth as possible for my son since it will be a big change.

Thanks so much!","I would stick to one person on the first day.  Go in, one hug and kiss, then get out of there. It’ll be easier for everyone the less time you spend In the room

I think it’s fine to alternate who takes him as long as you all are diligent about getting in and out quickly Hell fine either way. He'll get over it in a little bit. After a day or two he'll probably not even notice"
"Another post about screen time
For the first 8 months of my sons life, I wore him in my ergo baby carrier for seriously 100% of his naps. I was able to take my toddler to the park, bake, do chores…. But ever since he turned 9months old I don’t know what changed he needs to be IN bed, blackout curtains, white noise machine, nursed to sleep. 

My back feels better, but I ’m having a hard time because I feel like I have to do screen time for my 2 year old while I put him down now….

We used to watch one episode of Little Bear every like 3 days and now…. 

She gets up 6am and watches 1-2 episodes while my husband gets ready and goes to work
And then 1-2 episodes every time I put my son down (he has 2 naps a day). (Yes, she only watches Little Bear as well.)

She’s only 2.5 and cannot be quiet enough in the room while I nurse the baby to bed, and the 20mins it takes for me to put him down some days is just too long for her to play independently. And frankly I don’t feel super safe leaving her to wander the house and play with whatever while I’m not there to supervise? 

Just someone please tell me I’m overthinking and that my son needs to nap and this is okay…
I’m also doing the 1000 hours outside challenge with them this year so I PROMISE you we play outdoors every chance we get and have a full, busy, playful schedule otherwise. I’m just not used to letting her watch all this TV…","Relax. It's fine. TV is fine. It's the tablets and phones that make them psychos.

"Effective bonding
As a parent with a full time job getting home after 5, what are some bonding activities that you do with your toddler that they seem to enjoy to do at home with you?

"7th birthday party ideas for my son
I’m taking lead for planning my son’s birthday party this year. We’ve always usually gone to the local splash pad and had pizza. This year I’m planning on doing something at our house. We have a decent basement and a big backyard. I already sent out invites to a small group of his friends (7-8 kids). 

My original thought was to get small lego sets (about 200 pieces) for each kids for the first 30 minutes, then maybe an activity outside (things like 3-legged race (pairs, quick & silly), Bean bag race, Egg & spoon relay, Musical chairs
Obstacle course run (kids can time themselves or just race through). Then we come back in for cake and wrap up.

I’m not sure how it will go - so coming to Reddit to see if folks have done other things at home for this age? Give me your best ideas!

"The power of letting kids get bored
I used to panic whenever my son said, “I’m bored.” I’d rush to suggest activities, pull out board games, or let him watch TV. I thought I was failing if he wasn’t entertained or “learning” something.

But one weekend I decided not to jump in. He moped for a while… and then he started building this elaborate cardboard “arcade” with things from the recycling bin. It kept him busy for hours and he was so proud of it.

That moment made me realize, boredom is actually fuel for creativity. If I fill every minute for him, he never gets the chance to create something from scratch.

Now I try to hold back and let boredom do its magic. Curious, do you let your kids get bored, or do you step in with suggestions?","I say “ be bored. That’s when the magic happens.” Typically ends up in the same outcome as you. Took me awhile to get to that point like you. My 4 year old is a bit more stubborn than my 8 year old. But still works My mom used to give us chores if we complained about being bored. We learned to occupy ourselves real quick.

We tell our kids that only boring people get bored. They are pretty good at finding things to do, but both are outdoorsy kids and we just moved to a neighborhood with a shit load of kids so it's easy for them to run outside and find a playmate. They also play well together so we rarely get the ""I'm bored"" complaints. Only really if we are on a plane for more than 6 hours."
"Any one and done parents who added a second?
Hello everyone.. I have an amazing daughter who is currently 6. I thought we were one and done, but I’m now pregnant.. at the time of the birth there will be almost a 7 year age gap. My husband is super excited, I am more saddened by the fact that our daughter won’t be an only child any more. 

We travel every summer, she goes to private school. I was (am) a young first time mom, so I was kind of looking forward to having more freedom again, but that has now been delayed another 7ish years. 

As far as the age gap, any advice? I was massively parentified as a child and have no intentions of doing that to my child. TIA. 

ETA: thank you everyone for your comments and support!!","My brother is 6 years younger than me. What I find so special about it is that I remember so much from the day that he was born and his early childhood because I was old enough to and while we fought when we were younger, we are super close now that we are adults. I am seven years older than my brother, with no sibling in the middle. Our relationship was different but it was also lovely. I got to be an only child for nearly seven years. Then I had my own baby to play with. Then my brother was basically an only child because I went to college when he was 11. He got to go on trips solo with my parents and they all spent a lot of time together while I was off figuring out how to be an adult . So in a way, we both got to be only children for a bit. And now we're pretty close as adults. I don't know how my parents feel about it but I look back very fondly at my childhood with my baby brother."
"Emotional and physical safety tools
My kiddos respond best to fun tools and games that are flexible enough to be used in real life situations, so I’ve been working on finding ways to “gamify” life tips. It started with my son; he often has trouble with social cues, and his brain works so fast that he often blurts out sentences or other things in inappropriate environments, or with inappropriate people. So I came up with the Minefield game, to teach him about how certain topics or behaviors might be acceptable in one environment but not the other, and once he learned the concept, I created a code so that in public, I can alert him when he’s about to step on a “mine.” For example, when we go to my parents’ house, talking about his astronomy self-education or Harry Potter are no go’s, so I make eye contact and yank on my earlobe. Burping or farting at the store, or potty humor? Earlobe yank. 

Then when we started having some serious emotional outbursts due to sassing, bear-poking or other such sibling torture, we instituted feelings farts. I told them that when they’re feeling some kinda way, it’s okay to feel that way, but it’s not okay to lash out at everyone else. It’s like they’re crop-dusting their feelings and we all have to coexist with their emotional flatulence, and it stinks. They found this hilarious, of course, and so now the calm down methods are “emotional Beano”, and if someone makes the effort to be kind even if someone else is feeling-farting, it’s a feeling flower. Provocation can be called out by saying, “stop giving your sibling emotional burritos!” It’s safe in public because we can just sniff and react; either it stinks or ooooh that smells good. 

Just now, I created Zonk. Military vets MIGHT know this one. I plan to teach them to hide and not come out til it’s clear. If I catch them before they get to their safe place I’m gonna tickle them. If they beat me there I’m giving them a chocolate. Hopefully it’s only ever a game, but if our safety should ever be threatened, I can tell the kids to zonk and they will run for cover and not come out til I say it’s all clear. 

Does anyone have any other fun gamified safety tips to teach kids helpful skills without making them paranoid?","/u/popgiffins, Welcome to r/Parenting!

"Is it normal for a 6-year-old to say they have a crush?
My child just turned 6, and recently started talking about having a ‘crush’ on a classmate. It surprised me since they’re still so young. Is this normal at this age? How have other parents handled it when their kids start using the word ‘crush’ so early?","Yes it's very normal. 

I had 6yo students 2 years ago, some had crushes some were ""couples"".

But at this age, a crush can mean they truly have feelings for someone or simply that they find them extra nice. Couples were more like ""holding hands"" and being best friends but with someone of the opposite gender for example.

Some boys used to say they were ""couples"" simply between they were wearing the same T shirt or being on the same team in a bored game! It was more synonymous of ""team"" or ""duo"". yeah they are just repeating words, it's not like they actually know what a lot of these things mean. 

At one point when my oldest was 6, they had a bunch of weddings...hahah

when he was even younger he told me he wanted to marry me, because he wanted to be with me forever, so he wanted to marry me. I had to explain that you can't marry family... to which he said then how come you are married to mommy... hahah it was an interesting conversation"
"She fell asleep on my back
My daughter (8) and I have a bedtime routine that I stay in her bed until she falls asleep. We both enjoy this part of the night and use it as a way to connect. Tonight, she decided to lay on my back since she said she wanted to sleep on my back…. Told her to go for it …and she actually did fall asleep on my back. I’ve now officially become a koala. 🐨 

I know I’ll miss these moments once she gets older. Glad to have such a sweet moment with her tonight.","Cherish every moment, mom. You already know how fast it goes I still put my 3yo in a carrier but do it more on my back now that she’s getting bigger and heavier. She loves it and calls me mama koala when she’s on my back lol"
"Wife and I were one and done, but wife now wants another. At a loss as to what to do.
I'm writing this largely to just get it off my chest, and hear the thoughts of others as I'm at a real loss as to what to do. Essentially, my wife and I when we had our son who has just turned 3 were both one and done. While I remain this, my wife has recently told me that she'd like to have another child.

**Background**

My wife and I both 35 living in Sydney Australia. We got together in our early 20's, got married in 2019 and had our son in 2022. We make reasonable money and are relatively comfortable. We own our home (with a mortgage) and lead a relatively comfortable (if not modest) life - for example we have a budget that we try to stick to, we can afford grocceries etc, we have about 30K in savings, we can go out for dinner every now and again, but our savings typically fluctuates either up or down by $1000 a month depending on how much we save vs. any larger expenses. We do try to keep things sensible though - we don't do extravagant holidays or drive a particuarly fancy car for example.

**My wife's view**

About a month ago she mentioned that she was no longer one and done, and wanted to have another child. She'd mentioned a few times in the past that she'd had moments where she felt like she wanted to do it again, but had attributed this to mourning the loss of something that our son no longer did or had grown out of. However, over the last six months that feeling hadn't gone away and that she'd like to have one more.

With our son now 3, and with us being 35, she says that if we're going to do it, we should do it in the next year or so, or not at all, as she doesn't want a huge age gap between them and her biological clock is ticking.

**My response**

Following her telling me this we didn't speak about it for a couple of weeks (she told me on a day when we were both WFH right before I was heading into a meeting). I thought about it a lot and had planned to speak about it on a Sunday evening after our son had gone down. I wanted us to have some uninterrupted time where we both weren't exhausted from work. Unfortunately we got COVID, so neither of us were in the headspace for that conversation. Before I could broach the topic, my wife did while we were lying in bed a few nights ago.

I essentially outlined that I was still one and done based on the following:

* Financially we're able to live quite comfortably and provide a good life for our son. He's able to do activities, we can buy him things, experiences etc. Looking ahead, he's likely just going to get more expensive and I don't want to have him denied experiences or opportunites because we can't afford it.
* What I can provide as a dad - I want to be the best dad I can for my son, and I think I'm pretty good at it. However I think one of the reasons I am a good dad, is that by only having one I have the chance to 'fill my own cup' every now and again. If we bring another child into that, time for us becomes even more limited, and suddenly that cup I'm trying to pour from is empty, so the quality of my parenting would dip.
* Contentment with our current family - I love our family more than anything. I love the life we have. I love that we can provide a good life for our son, and I don't feel the urge
* Logistically having just the one child is much simpler. Between the two of us we can manage work, day care drop offs, activities etc.
* Space - our current home is four bedrooms (our room, our son's room, the study which I use as a home office, and the spare room which my wife uses as a home office). Having another child would mean losing either the spare room or the study leaving us with far less space (unfortunately with Sydney property prices and what we do for work, we can't afford to move anywhere larger).
* Fear of disabilites - This one I understand is a stretch, but I'm trying to be as honest as I can (and this was a concern with my first son), there are disabilites that can't be tested for.

At the end I suggested we perhaps speak with a couples counsellor to help us talk through this.

**Her response**

She was understandbly not happy with my views, and essentially took the line of ""we can make it work."" for all of the concerns I raised. While I agree, if we did end up having a child we could make it work, but at what cost? One point in particular that she spoke to was the financial side, citing that we still have a lot of our son's stuff that we could reuse, and that the child would only be on formula for the first six months (whereas I'm considering this from a two-decade long view and all the expenses that come with raising a child).

To her credit, she handled it really well all things considered. While we were speaking I asked how strong her urge to have another child was and she let me know it was a real desire, but not a burning desire that without it would leave her feeling incomplete as a person.

She didn't think a counsellor was necessary.

**Current situation**

I suggested we speak about it again the next weekend, to give us some time to think and allow us to have the convo when we both weren't exhausted from work.

Since then I've basically been thinking about it non-stop. I've acknowledged to myself that another child could be nice, but it's always immediately followed by all of the reasons I don't think it's the right move.

My above views haven't changed but feelings are:

* Guilt - I feel like I'm denying her something she really wants. We could make it work, but as I don't have the desire to expand our family beyond the 3 of us, I don't want to be in a position where we HAVE to make it work. Conversely, I'm also concerned that if we don't do it, what that will do to her? Is she going to think about it every time we hang out with or see a family of four?
* Worry of resentment - I'm worried that by denying her this, she'll resent me. I wouldn't blame her in the slightest. If the situation was reversed, I'd resent her.

I've had moments where I've considered just doing it. I know that when the concept of a second child actually became the reality of a second child, the parental insticts would kick in and I'd love it with everything I have, but I've always held the view that if you're not 100% sure on having a child, you shouldn't do it.

In a nutshell, I just feel like a piece of shit because I don't wan't, not that I can't, but that I don't want to have another child, and that as a result of my views, she's not able to have something she really wants.","You are gonna get a ton of comments here about how it’s two yeses required for a yes and one no for a no. So I’ll just give you another perspective that’s probably unpopular. 

My husband was a no to have a third kid. Very similar reasoning as you. I wanted another very much like your wife and basically went on a year campaign to change his mind. And he finally did change his mind. We had our third four months ago and he is so so happy he changed his mind and now wants another! He’s obsessed with his baby girl and is just loving life with her even though everything is absolutely crazy with another kid. 

I can tell you if my husband did not change his mind I absolutely would have been devastated, would have had to really fight feelings of resentment, and really would grieve. 

If your wife is like me, she can see the points you are making, but she’s not thinking about the next 5-10 years and how it will be harder and more inconvenient. She’s thinking about the rest of her life, 20-40+ years in the future and imagining what her Christmas table looks like when she is an old lady. That was my mindset and even though the “one no” trope is very popular, thinking far into the future about what I wanted my family to look and feel like trumped the shorter term concerns. If you fundamentally don't want a child, you dont need any reasons to defend it. Not wanting it is a sufficient reason to say no. In fact I'd say its the most important and acceptable reason to say no.

Your other concerns can be easily countered. Combining one home office from two is not a deal breaker and im willing to bet your wife will gladly lose her room and figure out working in common areas to make it work. As you can see, its easy to counter some of your concerns.

If you fundamentally just do no want a child you should lead with that.  But make peace with the fact that this may be make or break for the relationship long term. Number of kids, money, religion and core values are huge factors to be aligned on."

My son’s about to enter 6th grade and as a single mother I would love any tips on how to navigate these tween years and make memories together .

"How do you handle an adult child who doesn’t want to move out?
My child is now an adult healthy, graduated from their dream college, and even landed a good job. But they still want to live with me instead of moving out on their own.

As a parent, I feel torn. I’m happy they want to stay close, and with how expensive housing is these days, I completely understand. Honestly, living together also has benefits for me I feel more connected to younger perspectives and it helps me keep up with a fast changing world.

At the same time, I worry: if they stay home too long, will they ever become truly independent?

Has anyone else been in this situation? How did you handle it?","Is he living like a good roommate or like a sloppy adult child?


If hes a good roommate then whats the issue? If I had stayed at home rather than renting for the past 10 years I could probably afford a house."
"Mixed race son requires 中国旅行证
Greetings everyone, i am in a peculiar situation here and i want clarification, i (38M) Moroccan married to a Chinese woman (33F), we live in Dubai and we have a son 1yo, our son hold Moroccan passport and that was a choice by design since Morocco is pretty flixible when it comes to holding multiple passports unlike china.

The situation at hand is that we are planning to go to china for Vacation to see family, we prepared all necessary documents for a Q2 visa for both me and my son, we fulled the form and we got the approval on the portal consular.mfa.gov.cn, then when my wife went to the visa application center (VFS) they asked her for an additional document called  中国旅行证 (Travel document), they said that since he is a minor and his mother is chinese he will need this document   ... 

when i checked online i found a lot of confusing information, it mostly states that the document is issues to chinese minors born abroad to a chinese parent andnwho do not hold any other nationality, in other instances it says it's better we use it to go inside china and keep Moroccan passport for international travel, honestly oir trips to china are very rare, and i want to be on the safe side here so he can travel and see his grandma in the future. 

Anyone with experience here ?","Because his mother is Chinese he is considered Chinese until 18.

But because he does have a foreign passport and nationality (China do not allow dual citizenship) China came out with the Travel document thing.

It is like a passport but only for China, and it must always be accompanied by its main passport to be valid.

He won't need a visa to enter China, just his Maroccan passport and the Travel document. Your son's situation is called ""Conflicting Nationalities"", a term created by Chinese government to open a way for people to keep dual citizenship, because your son is considered by Chinese law to be a Chinese citizen, who just happens to also have the citizenship of another country when he was born. So unless your son specifically renounces his Chinese citizenship, he will always be considered by Chinese government a Chinese citizen and hence enjoy all the benefits of Chinese citizenship"

"Mobile comms in China
My son is a uni student in the UK and is going to China to study for 8 months, what are the best options for him to manage his mobile phone?","ChinaNet, ChinaMobile, ChinaUnicom

some Universities have partnerships with some cellphone service providers. Just let him get a Simcard there. I would recommend getting an Esim and installing it before Departure, so he has Internet as soon as he arrives A bit vague question, but if he's in China for such a long time, it makes sense to get a local SIM card. There are many providers such as: China Mobile, China Unicom, my favourite is China Telecom. An E-sim is also a possibility, I think you can get even before arriving in China, but I've never use it. With regards to accessing the internet, i also suggest getting a VPN before leaving the UK."

"I Wrote an Imagined Letter to Xi Jinping - and His Reply
tried something unusual: I wrote an imagined letter to Xi Jinping, as if he were an old friend of mine. In it, I talk about Yankees games, my son’s autism, and the grief of a woman I met in DC. It’s part humor, part heartbreak, and part moral plea. And then, I wrote his reply. It’s not satire, just to be clear. it’s an experiment in moral imagination. Sharing here because I think it shows something about how we wrestle with power, humanity, and cruelty all at once.

If there’s anyone on here who can put me in touch h with the real Xi, I’d really appreciate that.  I’d love to chat with him.","This is a useless exercise because it uses as a base premise that the Uyghurs are being discriminated against.

There is no mention of the US National Endowment for Democracy support of NGOs like the World Uyghur Congress, which is the primary source of the propaganda spread about the ""genocide"" in Xinjiang.  There's no mention of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, funded by the CIA to commit terrorist attacks across Xinjiang and which is the primary reason the Chinese government had to crack down.  Many members of the ETIM were ""ratlined"" to Syria after their defeat by Chinese government forces.  There was a Muslim Cleric visit to Xinjiang and they found no evidence of discrimination.

Pepe Escobar had an article that is at least 10 years old (maybe 15) describing the difficulty in ""industrializing"" Xinjiang.  When China began to invest in the area, Uyghurs were not qualified for the management positions so they mostly went to Han.  This discrepancy has almost been remedied as education in Xinjiang was very successful.

The author, [GREG SCADUTO](https://substack.com/@gregcscaduto), is a China fear monger.  I base this on several of his articles.  ""Be afraid of China, be very afraid.""

The reason China scares me is more because of the hegemony sought by the Anglo-American Oligarchy which is deeply involved with ""Empire and the Deep State"", which includes organized crime.  The Oligarchy/Deep State will commit any crime, for instance the Gaza Genocide, in order to gain control of any resources anywhere in the world.  They are the ones trying to sell the Taiwan invasion theory.  China has to react very, very carefully lest it become provoked into military action.

"How to tell if this chinese girl just needs attention or is just taking her time ?
Well, i live in Germany and had a Job interview and booked an AirBnBfor 2 days , i discovered that my host lives in the appartment, she's chinese.   
  
Day 1 : She offered to cook for me which i accepted at the condition we would go for the groceries first which we did. We started talking the whole night about human relationships (in general) from 6pm to 1a.m. I played some guitar (she's renting the house for a year and the owners have a guitar)  
She was looking sad so i asked what was going on ? she revealed how she struggled in life when she was in China and so on and mentionned that she bought a Kayak that she never used and wanted to try, well i do own one and i know how it works, so i offered her to do some kayaking after my job interview the next day. She asked me she would cook for me for lunch or was i getting late. Well i declined since i finish at 4pm.  
  
Day 2 : i missed lunch at work (interview is a 1 day work at hospital). Went back home and then we ate something quick then i asked her if she still wanted to do Kayak, She said yes so we went to do it for an hour.  After we went back home she told me, go have some rest i'll cook for you.  
She did i helped ofc, we ate and then we talked mainly about romantic relationships. She kept telling me you are so rare cause you're like the Standard of healthy relationships and so on as she heard me talk to my mom and friends after the job interview when i went back home.   


2 Days later:  i sent her a reel showing a place in Europe she told me she wanted to visit someday. She said she wanted to travel next week, i didn't know if she was suggesting or not so i told her if you want some accompany let me know as i would like to travel too before starting to work.  
So we ended up planning a 3 days trip to Austria, which went very well.   
She asked me about my religion and if my future wife should follow it and if my son too etc..  
Ater that the 2nd day of the trip she told me she made the decision to go work in japan next year as she was staying here in germany just for a year.  


After that she told me it was ehr best trip, and that i was rare because we 'connected' that deep and i made her 'felt seen'.

During all those times no kiss no touching nothing.  
Since everything seemed platonic even with some interest i moved back.  


2weeks laters she told me : well i think what you said about my anxiety was right, knowing what i have helped me, i should treat you a diner. I replied i would love to. She said she meant it and we ended up planning it the last friday.   
Friday Diner : As i arrived she told me ok let's go to the museum of the city, she made me a tour of it and then we went back home, she cooked for me we talked a lot. Again the romantic relationship subject popped up. I noticed how she was doing BF/GF thigns with me and told her you have a need and you need to pursue it in general not talking about me. It's normal, as she had childhood trauma with her parents not showing her much love, she said, i don't need it i don't want to wake up every morning next to someone. I emphasized that she was going too deep into the relationship so early even when it's just theoretically. Well i didn't push anymore, i just wanted to go back home.  
I had to take my train but since we been feeding the ducks and watching sunset i missed it.  
We went back home waiting for the next, so i moved a bit away from her and went to the next room (no door it's a big open area) and played some guitar, she came around me while playing and soon as i put my phone on charge she took it and tried to play some. I asked if she wanted to learn she said yeah, well you all know how it goes it becomes touchy , we were like holding hands, she didn't avoid or anything she accepted it, and even gave me a look in the middle of it, i honestly melted, but couldnt go further since she turned awa right after. Well she tayed next to me side by side for a long 5min after that while diving into her phone. She's more smiling and more talkative ever since even on Instagram.

Yesterday i asked how was life going (3 days after the diner), and we talked she told me she decided to stay longer in Germany and maybe find a job here.

My question is, is she just wanting someone to support her emotionnaly as a friend or is she pursuing step by step something more romantic ?

Note that her past made her have an avoidant kinda perosnnality when it comes to commitment.","I think she's very much into you.  The avoidant personality you mentioned is common among Chinese, and some Chinese girls are afraid to be seen as too forward in pursuing a relationship.

However, I would caution you as well that you barely know this girl, you know her from an online transaction basically, so be on your guard.  Could be someone who's just looking for anyone to get married to so they can stay in your country, as much as it could be someone who's genuinely interested in you.  See whether she probes you about your finances.  On the flip side, if she can afford to spend a year in Germany doing nothing, she might also be from a wealthy Chinese family, and doing Airbnb is just a way for her to meet new people. If this story is true, you seem very naive, and perhaps very nice, likely both. All the signs are there that she's into you. Of course, it's good to be cautious since she could be using you to stay in the country, but it could be worth exploring to see if it's genuine, particularly if you have an interest in her. 

If you are interested in her, what the heck are you waiting for? I'm not sure what more she could have done to show you, other than grab your face and kiss you."
