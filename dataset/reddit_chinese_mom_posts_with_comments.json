She no longer cooks white rice, beef, or mi xao as well as using less salt because my mom and dad are trying to take care of their health.\n\nI tried to stick with their diet by eating larger portions, but I can barely function throughout the day. I often dry heave during workouts, sometimes throughout the day, and have symptoms of hyponatremia. \n\nNow, I cook my own food or eat out to feel satisfied. It's awful because I feel like I am insulting her cooking. Because of our work schedules, the only time my family meets consistently is at dinner. Sometimes I am too tired to cook, so I just eat out. \n\n The other day, she scolded me for drinking liquid IV and coming home with a beef shawarma, saying it was going to damage my kidneys.  I know she cares, but I never knew caring for myself feels like alienating my mom. \n\nHave you guys ever gone through anything similar? I just wanted to vent and get opinions on this.",

That’s heritage food and probably what you’re wanting. You can make the broth from any veggies for extra fiber, season as like, cook in bulk, and you can freeze it in advance.

I even went out of my way to not get too close to other Asians. \n\nNow, I’m an adult and I see that anime and Asian food are getting extremely popular. There’s so much anger in me that people I saw make fun of me are now embracing what they made fun of me for. I feel cheated out of a happy childhood where I could learn about my heritage worry free. I’ve been trying to learn Mandarin, and learn more about Taiwanese culture and history. While it’s been great, I still constantly have to remind myself to get rid of the bias I held against Asian for so long. I also constantly have to work past the regret of denying my heritage and shunning other Asian people. \n\nI’m sure I’m not the only one with this experience. Anyone else gotten past the hurt and feeling cheated? I would love some dialogue on this\n\nAlso does anyone have advice on how I might connect with more Asian people?

Someone would have to break me to pieces then rebuild me to loosen the chokehold that Asian beauty standards has on me.\n\nToday I forgot my wallet and with the little cash on me I had to choose whether or not I wanted a meal or get a makeup cushion that was on sale, guess which one I chose? Even after getting the cushion I felt disappointed when I realized \"Wait this is my shade\" because I need something lighter.\n\nIt takes me about an hour and a half just to get ready for a class reunion; Peel and stretch my double eyelid tape, wait it looks wrong let's peel it off, stick then rip it off and repeat. My double eyelids looked painfully fake so I decided to apply cluster lashes to cover it. My makeup looked great!! However while looking at myself in the mirror, I remembered the last step; To apply my tone up cream, make sure to look pale, lather it on and spread it evenly on both hands, and clean my nails after because it looks white.\n\nEven back in High School in America, I remember applying tone up creams to my body to look paler, \"prettier\" for prom. I'm slowly drowning in the pool that I filled up, but this was influenced by my childhood when  growing up in Asia I was voted the ugliest girl in 5th grade. Actually a classmate from 5th grade managed to recognize me (not at the reunion, randomly in public) and I almost went on a spiral because \"Am I still the ugliest girl? Haven't I changed enough?\"\n\nBut in reality I have changed a lot, so many people at the reunion could not put a finger on who I was, the guy who recognized me in public was an incredibly close friend whom I spent most my time with back then, which is why he recognized me. Sorry that this got so long but in the end Asian Beauty is a noose that I willingly tighten around my neck. Maybe one day I'll work through my past and my self confidence.\n\nBut then again I've only lived in the USA for about 4 years and I feel like no matter how far I am from Asia I will forever hold myself up to their beauty standards. But also I'm still young, I'm about to go into college in the USA and scared shit-less of how I can maintain my tedious routine (I still feel the need to fit the Asian Beauty Standards in America). Even on my college ID, I decided to submit a headshot where I'm wearing my double eyelids not to mention the crazy editing where I look whiter than a paper FML.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, posting using a throwaway account, as this is a sensitive topic for my family. I’m reaching out to this community with a heavy heart and an open mind, hoping to understand how best to approach a situation that has been increasingly difficult for my family.\n\nWe’re a well-educated Indian family—both my wife and I are physicians—and we’ve lived in the U.S. for over 18 years. About a year and a half ago, we moved to a highly ranked public school district in New York, motivated by the reputation of its schools and the promise of a welcoming, intellectually driven neighborhood.\n\nMost of our neighbors here are of Chinese heritage. We were aware of that going in, and honestly, it didn’t concern us in the slightest. Over the years, we’ve had many close friendships with Chinese colleagues in medical school and university—so we anticipated a diverse, respectful environment.\n\nHowever, the experience we've had here has been unexpectedly isolating. Our child is the only South Asian child in her elementary school class (class composition is 17 Chinese; 2 Caucasian, 1 Indian). An early observation we had was that despite inviting every child in the class to her birthday party, she received only 3 invites in return (1 Chinese classmate, and the 2 Caucasian classmates). We shrugged this off thinking that we were new in the neighborhood, and this hopefully would change with time. However, a year and a half later we still barely get any play date or birthday invites.\n\nWhen we walk through the neighborhood and greet others, our Chinese neighbors rarely respond—not even a nod or wave—while neighbors of other backgrounds tend to acknowledge us. It’s subtle, but it’s consistent enough that it’s hard to ignore.\n\nMore painfully, our daughter was bullied at school by a group of Chinese classmates. One child told her that I (her dad) must be ashamed of her because of how she looks. When confronted by the teacher, the group’s ringleader said she didn’t like how my daughter disagreed with her in class. The incident was reported, and while the school addressed it on some level, we’re left with the deeper discomfort of whether this reflects something broader.\n\nI’m not sure if what we’re experiencing is cultural disconnect, cliquish behavior, or something rooted in bias—but it’s unlike anything we’ve encountered in other communities we’ve lived in. I’d love to hear from others who’ve navigated similar situations:\n\n* Is this something that improves over time with more engagement?\n* Are there ways to bridge cultural gaps that feel this resistant?\n* At what point do you consider whether a community is simply not the right fit for your family?\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts, perspectives, or personal experiences you’re willing to share.",

In other words, maybe there were 5 parties and and your child was excluded from 2 as opposed to 16 parties? \n\nAnother possibility is that the invite list might have been via WeChat or some other messaging method. Kids might be in other activities where the invite was distributed that way. I can't see a school sending out a custom invite list per party on a parent's behalf.\n\nHopefully friendship(s) will be formed but if your daughter is miserable about school, I wouldn't wait too long to move.

I can imagine that Chinese immigrant parents who are not fluent in English might feel uncomfortable reaching out to parents who don't know Chinese and prefer to stay in their comfort zone of other fellow Chinese parents.

If all goes well, they should grow to about $1.6 million by then, and I’ll be able to fully retire early and comfortably. Before you ask how I'm able to retire early with such little money, please understand that I grew up in poverty, so I am extremely frugal by nature.\n\nIn addition to my investments, I'm currently in the process of saving $200k in a high-yield savings account. I’ve been thinking about using it to help pay off our mortgage. We still owe about $230k. If I put in $200k, it would really help my parents pay it off faster. They’re in their late 50s now. I was the main reason we left our rent-controlled apartment, and I sometimes feel guilty about uprooting them from that stability.\n\nOur mortgage has a 3.5% interest rate through an FHA loan, so I don’t think refinancing is an option. Even with a big payment, the monthly mortgage payment would stay around $2,000.\n\nMy own financial goals are already met.

I'm really just trying to cope with this loneliness. I've talked about this with my immediate family, but the fact that they're still deep in their faith doesn't necessarily help. Their solution is often in prayer, and yeah, this hasn't helped me. I love them, and I know they love me in their own way. So this isn't about that.   \n  \nMy siblings seem mostly okay with their identity. I've been struggling with mine ever since someone asked me, \"Are you Cantonese?\" in kindergarten. So yes, I am Chinese American. Supposedly. My father was born in the Philippines, but his father was born in Shanghai, and his mother was born in Jamaica to rich Chinese parents. So nationally, that's confusing af. If it clears anything, they were both part of WHO. \n\nMy mother was born in either southern China or Hong Kong. There's disagreement on this. Her father seems to be Canadian-born from Chinese parents. Her mother was adopted, but agreed that she was from a small village in Southern China where they had to leave my mom as a baby during war times. Her siblings are American-born.\n\nWith that shit in mind, I'm confused af. \n\nThe TLDR; version of that is my parents came over to the U.S. at a young age. My father at 13 and my mom at 8 years old. (If anyone can parse out which generation I am in, let me know, because I don't know.) We only spoke English, and if there was any Chinese culture shown, it was during CNY (politically correct to be Lunar New Year). My parents found community in the Christian faith, but it's the kind of faith where they're bigoted and close-minded. Again, I still love them, but politics have to be put aside if I can even tolerate it. \n\nMore recently in my life, I was officially diagnosed with Autism and inattentive ADHD. Being a cis woman (also married) who has been fighting against internalized sexism and racism, and recently ableism... I feel even more marginalized. \n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what to do with this, but maybe someone can suggest some things I can read about to help curb this loneliness? Maybe even a therapist? Does anyone have stories they want to share? \n\nI have interacted with other Asian Americans and have friends, but their experiences are more straightforward, including my spouse... i.e. they know their mother language and their culture is mostly intact, laced with American, and seem mostly okay with this. Most times, they look at my reactions like I'm a baby, which is fair. I am overly sensitive (mostly due to the Autism). And I'm here unraveling every month.",

    "selftext": "Many of us have encountered the pervasive stereotypes that paint Asian Americans—or what is deemed \"authentic\" Asian culture—as introverted, conformist, and solely focused on academics. These assumptions not only oversimplify a diverse community but are also used within our own community to gatekeep what it means to be \"a real Asian.\" Why?\n\nI've personally been labeled as \"white-washed\" or \"too Westernized\" more times than I can count, usually for being extroverted, flirty, overconfident, defiant of authority, and craving the spotlight. My interests—sports, competition, partying, leadership roles, and public speaking—have often been seen as departures from traditional Asian norms. But here's the thing: my values don't stem from growing up in America. My sisters, born in Vietnam, share similar traits.\n\nMy mother, who reached adulthood in Vietnam, used to sneak out of her home as a teenager to study judo, in direct defiance of her parents' rules. She made it all the way to brown belt before she was discovered (she's standing proudly on the right in the pictures below). In college, she actively participated in protests—marching, holding signs, and speaking at political rallies. Later, she became a liberal college professor of literature at the University of Saigon.  My mother, the badass, is the most important influence on my life and is the one who taught me that the pinnacle of success requires you to be well-rounded: athletically, academically, financially, and romantically (**\"văn võ song toàn\"** (文武雙全)).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2q1qayz3ro8f1.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=409baae6934f2aa1ef8b3c7267e325c80b675652\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2qh6545ro8f1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=797ba6a6e86286b54cb6f8eb0dbd453820a4af34\n\nMy father grew up as a street urchin, hustling and making money any way he could, before serving as a captain in the South Vietnamese military, holding significant leadership roles. He wooed my college-educated mother despite lacking an academic background.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzo6xzcfso8f1.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e97ef71f126c31a65a863479c782e56fba638fc\n\nHis father was a smuggler who used his connections to organize refugee escape boats—you've probably heard of the \"boat people\"; my grandfather orchestrated those escapes using his fleet of boats and ability to bribe and smuggle. I last saw him at 97, recently recovered from a motorcycle accident, still insisting on riding to show off to me, his grandson, that he was still cool and strong. He had four concurrent wives at one point and lived to 103.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s58ibuetso8f1.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f2ea5eb96e4c67ceecbbabb2bd5e9154b3b41c\n\nSo, I submit that it's essential to recognize that traits like extroversion or defiance are not exclusive to any one culture. This internal gatekeeping suggests that certain traits or interests are less \"authentically Asian,\" reinforcing narrow definitions of identity. While some Asians may more closely align with certain stereotypes, it's a mistake to suggest anyone is any less Asian for acting in opposition to these stereotypes. And why give White culture a monopoly on extroversion?\n\nFurthermore, if being confident, gregarious, or non-conforming - or liking sports or art or socializing - helps you succeed in Western society, you don't need to feel like you're doing so at the expense of your Asian heritage or as assimilating. Why are only Asian people put in this box, while any other race can feel free to be loud or quiet, introverted or extroverted, as they please? Do it if you want to!  Hell, do it better!\n\nI want to broaden our understanding of what it means to be Asian or Asian American. Embracing the full spectrum of personalities, interests, and values within our community allows for a more inclusive and authentic representation and enables us to take greater ownership of our identity. Let's celebrate and support each other's individual rights to define who we are beyond societal expectations.",

    "selftext": "I was raised abroad & so I don't know if this is just \"Filipino\" culture or not so I thought I would ask here. I visit the Philippines every 2 years or so and when I do, I come bringing pasalubong gifts that are designer and/or inconvenient to bring across the world. I was doing well at work and so over the last year, I sent a lot of money to my close relatives who asked -- it was at least hundreds of USD per person, at least when I was in a good mood to send or depending on who asked. I know it's just money and I shouldn't expect anything when I give it out (and I don't), I also know that the phone works both ways, I'm just appalled that **among all of my relatives in the Philippines**, **the ones who reach out to me whenever they need money or when I'm posting fun things on my stories**, who I also reach out to when it's their birthdays, **not one single person remembered to wish me a happy birthday**. \n\nActually, for some reason, I felt like since I was growing quiet on my social media and stopped uploading stories, my cousins weren't replying to any of my messages anymore except occasionally when they needed help with tuition/prom/graduation/medication bills, that maybe I shouldn't post as much to see who would still reach out. This time, I stayed quiet around my birthday, and sure enough, no one reached out. Not a single person. It's just Facebook or instagram, I'm not looking for attention, I have friends here who are foreign-born or foreign-raised Filipinos like I am and so they can understand how I feel, but even one message from my actual family would have been nice. I'm supposed to go this summer to the Philippines and instead of using the money I would usually spend on gifts or giving it to whoever asks, I think I'm just going to use it on more travel. The problem is, it doesn't feel enough. I'm still so angry. I really want to speak out about it to my uncles and aunts and cousins but my parents say it's just how the people are in the Philippines. Is this true? Should I speak up about it or let it go and just forget it?\n\nI want to add that one of the reasons I should \"let it go\" is because this family treated my mother very well when she had nothing. I was also a bridesmaid to a wedding, and generally this is the family that tours us around when we come over for vacation. I don't want things to be awkward but I don't know. Is there something I'm missing / am I being self-centred and is there something I should have done?",

        "body": "I’m not Fil-Am but the Philippines is like a second home in my heart ever since I visited there with my high school buddy when we were 14. When I was younger I also did volunteer work with various NGOs helping the poor in SEA, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa; sometimes the NGO was church (Catholic) affiliated, sometimes not. Over the years I worked in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong so I often stayed in the Philippines on the weekends at least once a month. I’m quite familiar with and feel affinity to what’s called the “D” and “E” classes in the Philippines since I grew up in poverty during the 1980s and 1990s. Squatter houses in the urban informal settlements and the shacks out in the “bukid” don’t bother me. DE’s make up something like 93% of the Filipino population. These are the urban poor and rural poor. My high school buddy’s family are considered “A” class (the rich and affluent), so during my first visit they advised me to stay within the compound in Batangas or at least, the gated subdivision but I quickly went outside to see the country for myself.\n\nMy personal experience is that the poor Filipinos will assume I’m a Korean or Japanese and treat me with deference. When they find out I’m an “Amerikano,” the deference increases. When they realize I’m comfortable with them even if they’re poor, they treat me like any other Filipino person, which includes starting to ask me for help which invariably will go to asking for money. I think there are many cultural reasons for this behavior, but it boils down to the core ancestral culture shared among all Filipino ethnic groups of the datu-barangay relationship, or that of a provider vs the recipients. Of course things have shades of gray and are much more complicated and I don’t mean to simplify/flatten the explanation. Basically in a datu-barangay relationship the people will follow the provider, or they may jump ship and follow another provider. Look no further than Philippine politics and the mad rush towards whoever has the most money for vote bribes during election week.\n\nOn a more personal, family level, a family often has this provider-receiver relationship. I can go on and on about how many sad stories I’ve listened to personally of (mostly female) OFWs who basically feel forced by a twisted version of utang na loob to work abroad supporting their family back home. Even my good friend of 14 years whose son I’m the ninong of, regularly asks me for money. There’s always an excuse or a reason, and honestly I can’t be really sure if they would use the money for the purpose they claimed. On the Philippines subreddit there are regular anonymous posts about the anxiety Filipinos feel about being the sole breadwinner for their family, the guilt trips they get if they don’t hand over money, then them realizing their parents/sibling/relative used the money to go on vacation or buy a new motorcycle but not for the stated purpose the relative cried about in the first place. If someone draws the boundary and says no, mostly they will get passive “I understand you” in a guilt-trippy voice, but sometimes the relative will go full “war freak” and try to go from the angle of indigent rage.\n\nGenerally it’s best to keep money out of relationships with your relatives. Help if you can, if you want to help, but never where it damages your own mental health and financial wellbeing. If you feel very strongly about helping let’s say your niece or nephew get a better education, pay for their tuition directly to their school and never give money to the child’s parents (I learned this the hard way lol). I’ve dated literally only one Filipina in the past, and her mother kept asking me to “help” build a new house, so I went there and built the house with my own hands (I did work with Habitat for Humanity before and am handy). Let’s just say the mother was not happy with that, since she actually wanted a washing machine and a tiled kusina after her chismosa buddy was boasting about that lady’s new stuff. But oh well, I did build a new house so that’s that.",

His younger brother is following his footsteps\n\nI know it’s partly his age, partly not having a man figure, partly iPad/screen. He loves his iPad and Netflix/disney+. He’s generally a nice boy to hang with his friends. But…. With me… he’s an asshole.\n\nAnd the burden of being alone, a full time corporate employee, still not over being cheated on (I know my ex got married this summer- so I am battling resentment), and my sons’ not following simple instructions is slowly draining all the love I have for them. It kills me to write this.\n\nThese boys were my world- I used to be the mom Jumping on the trampoline with them, running after them at parks, waking up at 6 am because I don’t want to miss 1 minute.\n\nNow, they are a responsibility. Make sure they are fed and drop them at school. That’s it.\n\nI am emotionally distant from them. They can feel it.\n\nThe behavior I can’t handle is the disrespect. The amount of times I have heard “I hate you” and “I wish you are dead” this summer is more than I can bear.\n\nI always try to plan play dates, at least 3-4 times a week (during summer break). But getting them out the door screaming and shouting is getting on my last nerves. They don’t want to leave the house. I end up dragging them by their shirts to the outing. The eldest shouts and screams the entire drive about how I’m a horrible mom, forcing him to go out, forcing him to do things he doesn’t want, how he hates me, wishes I never existed.\n\nThen I end up asking them 12736 times to leave the play area. Then my son would say “sorry I was mean”. But I just don’t care anymore. I would rather he doesn’t talk to me anymore.\n\nEverything is tiring. I know it’s probably screen addiction.

I don’t know how to make them follow simple instructions like brush your teeth and put on your shoes.\n\nWhat angered me enough to write this post is that over the weekend, at my parent’s house (the whole family was gathered for the weekend), my kids woke up early so they sat watching tv while we were all sleeping (7 am) I woke up at 8:30 (it’s the weekend). Anyway I let them watch tv so I can drink my coffee, brush my teeth change my clothes (etc). I started telling them to turn off their iPads/tv by 9:15 and just go outside and play (this kept going). Later by 11 I gave them squares of aluminum foil and scissors and said “let’s make swords!! Or a robot!”. Shouts and screams like I had hit them. I kept turning off electronics and telling them to go play outside on the bikes, check the plants, etc. cue screams and shouts and tears. But when your son screams at the top of his lung and says the rudest meanest things infront of people, you tend to just want him to shut up and give you peace.\n\nI gave up. Then when I was packing to go back home, they went outside to explore, and made a Huge fuss about going back home and that they wanted to check the ants and bugs outside.\n\nI’m going out of my mind. I don’t want to be a mom.\n\nI know it’s also probably resentment knowing that their father is living his single life while I am “trying” to parent and failing. It’s also them knowing how to manipulate the situation in their favor. But I don’t care if they spend 17 hours a days on screen anymore. They’ll live.\n\nBut the guilt is too strong",

Once things have calmed down and the sorries come out (the real ones) I always sit down with them and tell them how much I love them. How much their behavior can upset me. That’s the part I look forward to - the post-screaming cuddles. \n\nAnd don’t forget. Despite what they’re saying, they do love you. But at that age they aren’t fully capable to understanding the effect that their words and actions can have on people. Especially you. Remember your own parents at that age. I’m sure you weren’t always nice to them. But did it ever occur to you at the time that maybe you were hurting them like this? Probably not. I know it didn’t for me. \n\nThey won’t really appreciate all you’re doing until they’re older. But don’t ever forget that underneath it all they need you and they love you.",

Football and homecoming is a big deal here in the south*\nI want to preface this with I completely understand where his parents are coming from and do not fault them at all. This is just my heart breaking for my daughter. \n\nMy daughter(7th grade), asked a boy \"friend\" to homecoming. She didn't tell us that she was even thinking of asking anyone as she never talks about him in a romantic way. The boy said, \"Sure, why not?\"\n\n Girls are getting asked to homecoming left and right and for the 2nd year no one has asked her. Everyone shows off their giant mums and garters on game day. This boy is on her cross country team and they sit next to each other in one class. Unlike many boys their age, he's always been friendly, nice, and funny. After asking if he thinks of her more than friends, she says he's like that with everyone and she doesn't think he likes her like \"that.\" Her intention was as a friend who wanted to go to homecoming but didn't want to go with a gross and disrespectful boy.\n\nThis morning his mom let me know that the family agreed that he was too young to \"date\" this year and he couldn't go to homecoming/dances. He was aware of this and said yes anyway. The mom said he was very flattered and most likely caught up in the excitement of being asked. That said, the boundary is strict and he has to back out of it. Again, I understand and respect this fully! \n\nIt's been a conversation with her friends that they've said yes to boys only to be nice. As a mom, it was my worry that he said yes out of feeling on the spot and not wanting to hurt her feelings. I small part of me thinks his mom is covering him on this part. Of course, feel bad thinking this way about it. She's not ugly at all but a little different in style(not sporty clothes)/interests(Korean stuff) than her peers. She isn't flirty and isn't as interested in non-platonic relationships as other girls. She's had crushes, and has told them she likes them, but none of them ever liked her back.\n\nIt takes guts to ask a boy out and I'm so proud of her for taking it into her own hands. Her confidence is my biggest worry. I was thinking of showing her the text the mom sent as it's neutral and kind. I haven't even responded to the mom yet as I'm still processing it.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter years of trying and multiple miscarriages, I’m (36F) 20 weeks pregnant and expecting a girl in January. My husband and I are obviously thrilled, but there’s something nagging at me and that something is my mom.\n\nMy mom has histrionic personality disorder and therefore has issues with respecting other people’s boundaries. Like when I ask her not to mention my pregnancy to people I don’t know, she tries to post it on Facebook anyway. Or when I ask her not to buy me a million baby clothes, she does so anyway. Or sometimes it’s more serious, for example when I ask her not to smoke in front of me now that I’m pregnant and she does it anyway. That kind of stuff. Apart from this personality disorder she’s chronically on high doses of morphine for back issues and will drink wine with it in the evening, although she says ‘it’s not much’. She has a history of alcohol addiction when I was a child, so I’m very weary and don’t like to be around her at night.\n\nNow the current issue: she’s made multiple comments on how she wants/expects to babysit when baby is here. My husband and I are apprehensive because of her opioid use and her breaking promises like not smoking around me while I’m pregnant etc. On the other hand: my dad is in assisted living with dementia and my in laws are deceased, so we have a very little ‘village’ so to speak. On the one hand she’s the only grandparent my daughter will have. My sister lives in another country and my husband isn’t in contact with his siblings.\n\nWhat do we do?! Allow her to babysit short amounts of time? Just at our house? Or no babysitting at all and just visiting? Maybe when the child is a bit older? She commented on us getting an extra bed in the house so she can stay over all the time, so she’s very set on it. How do I set and enforce boundaries, or is that wishful thinking?\n\nI know my main focus should be the safety of my child and not my mother’s feelings, I’m just lost how to go about it. Any experience or advice is welcome, also please let me know if you think I’m just overreacting - my upbringing with her alcohol abuse was quite traumatic at times, so it could blur my vision. I’m also looking to find advice in that regard: would others also not let her babysit?",

    "selftext": "For back story and context : my grandma lives in a duplex with us. She lives on one side, and we (me, my husband, and 2 kids ages 10 and 11) live on the other side.\n\nLast year my kids were going to a school out of district. I wanted them to go to the one that is literally 6 houses down from us but my grandma and mom didn’t agree and ended up saying they’d pay the tuition for the other school and contribute in to driving them as they thought the out of district school was better. I ended up giving in as long as they kept their end of the deal. Throughout the year it became a fight because they no longer wanted to be in charge of driving them. (I couldn’t be there to drive them every day). So for this year I switched them to the school down the street to avoid more fighting. The out of district school clearly wasn’t working out and resentment was growing. \n\nWell, now they’re walkers. They seem to like it. I like it. It’s so much easier and I assumed my grandma would have nothing to anrgue about with me. However she’s still inserting herself. She doesn’t like that I don’t physically walk them. I did at first so they’d know what to do, but now Ive trusted them to do it themselves. I wait on the porch for them after school and every day my grandma has yelled at me about how I’m not doing it right and should be walking to get them. \n\nToday it came to a heated discussion because it was raining. I had warned my kids that it would be raining when they got done with school and had asked if they wanted picked up. They both said they were fine and that they enjoy their walk home alone so I just made sure they’d be dressed appropriately for the rain. My grandmother ended up leaving the house to walk down to get them with an umbrella for really no reason at all imo. It was sprinkling by time they were done. When they returned it turned in to a disagreement between her and I. That’s kind of whatever to me at this point and I’m not asking what to do about my relationship with her. it ended with me saying that maybe she should take a break from involving herself with my children since it’s clearly stressing her out. \n\nBut now that I’ve had some time to think about what has been said to me I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing for my children. Like are my kids too young to be walking themselves? Am I being an inadequate parent by letting them walk in the rain at all? I just don’t know what to do or what the right answer is for us going forward. ",

    "selftext": "So here’s the situation: my daughter is an only child. We’ve known her best friend since kindergarten, and whenever we go on family trips we usually bring her along. This summer we took her with us to the Wisconsin Dells and stayed at Kalahari for a week, and honestly, it made the trip so much better for my daughter since her cousins are all way older (high school and college age), and she gets bored around them.\n\nNow we have a bigger trip coming up — we’re going to St. Barts. Everything is already paid for: villa, flights, food, excursions. I keep going back and forth on whether I should invite her best friend again. On one hand, it would make the experience so much more fun for my daughter. On the other hand, St. Barts is obviously a big luxury trip, and I’m not sure if it’s crossing a line to bring someone else’s kid.\n\nIt’s not a money thing for them. Her dad is in his last year of residency for neurosurgery, and her mom is a real estate agent, so they could absolutely afford to send her if they wanted. But when their family goes on trips — Disney, Florida, even a ski trip to Aspen last year — they always bring my daughter too, so it feels like it balances out.\n\nMy only concerns are: is it weird to bring another family’s child on an international luxury trip? Would it make things awkward if we cover everything? Am I setting myself up to always have to bring her on every trip?\n\nAt the same time, I feel like she’s part of the family at this point. We’ve known her for years, she’s a really good kid, and my daughter truly sees her as a sister. I just don’t want to overstep, or make her parents feel like I’m spoiling her in a weird way.\n\nWould you bring the best friend along, or keep this one just family?",

There’s no more room to cut our budget and we’re already run ragged and exhausted from both picking up overtime to make ends meet.

We both feel safe about it, she is a very trustworthy and rule-following child. She is mature enough to follow all safety rules put in place and we would make sure all doors and windows are locked. We would be able to leave one of our cell phones home with her and have my mom call her every 15 minutes to check in (mom is a 4 hour drive away but can call police if my daughter doesn’t answer the phone).

    "selftext": "I’m in Texas, and my 4-year-old just started Pre-K about 3 weeks ago under the ESL category. I recently found out that she’s already had recess taken away at least twice - once for jumping on her way to recess and another time for not listening to instructions.\n\nI only learned about this now, not from the teacher’s daily reports but from my child and another parent. I’m truly heartbroken realizing she’s been going through this without me knowing.\n\nAt this age, recess is one of the only times she gets to relax, play, and connect with classmates - especially as she’s still learning English and adjusting to a whole new environment. Taking it away feels harsh.\n\nI honestly think there are better ways to teach kids how to follow instructions than isolating them from play.\n\nIs this common practice in Texas public schools? Has anyone else experienced this, and how did you handle it?",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm the dad of a wonderful 11 year old daughter that just entered 6th grade. Mom and I have been separated for 9 years. Daughter spends close to equal time with both of us. \n\nMy daughter has been struggling in school the last few years. Last year I got her diagnosed with ADHD at the end of the year and got her on an IEP. She certainly has ADD- but a lot of her struggles have been due to not putting in the effort- likely because of the ADHD. \n\nWell its a fresh start this year in middle school. And for the first time, she is properly medicated. I got her a phone last year because there were two days a week where she would have to be alone for about an hour. But I got a massive promotion and now work from home. \n\nI told my daughter before school started that she would have to be involved in some kind of extra curricular that has a GPA requirement in order to have an unlocked phone. \n\nDaughter agreed- but when school started she said it wasn't fair and complained to her mom. Her mom got extremely upset abd said I was being unfair and that she doesnt want our daughter doing extra curricular because she wants her help at home with the baby. \n\nMom also moved 1.5 hours away and I'm sure the commute is also an issue- even though I said I would do all the driving. \n\nI backed off a little and said if she wants her phone- she will need to have a very high GPA with zero missing assignments. And her phone would be locked until she proves she is doing the right thing. \n\nMom called this rediculous and said she would just buy her a phone if I don't relent. \n\nI don't feel like I am out of line here. In my mind- a phone for an 11 year old is not a necessity. It's something extra. And if she wants it, then she should put in extra effort. \n\nTo my daughter's credit- she has been doing amazing in school. Though its only been about 6 weeks. But she really is out of chances with ne when it comes to school. \n\nNow I am the bad guy for having standards- which I am fine with.

    "selftext": "We notified last minute on Wednesday morning that our kids are able to attend a field trip to a local fair in town for about 2 1/12 hours about 5 blocks away from school. Teacher can only take 6 parent volunteers to chaperone. There’s 22 students. I volunteered with my permission for me and my kids today since they were handed out yesterday. I guess I was not one of the first parents to reach out (I’m assuming the other parents who were picked personally messaged teacher to volunteer) \n\nSo now my 6 year old will need to ride in another parents vehicle to the fair and back to school and I also have to provide a car seat for them or else they will not be able to go. My son is so excited to attend the field trip he’s been talking about it since they found out.\n\nTeacher shares a message with the parents letting us know she understands our kids are still so little and wishes we can all attend but are not able to because the fair will be closed the public at the time. So as far as I know it will only be our kids on a field trip and not sure if any other school will be going as well…. I’m a little hesitant now on sending him but I also want him to have fun. \n\n\nWhat would you do?? ",

    "selftext": "I know that i frequently react poorly to a lot of disappointments. I am not great at modeling patience. Not being able to quickly work through my emotional response is a huge issue for me. I desperately need to work on this but fully just do not know how. Talk therapy in the recent past (2-3 years ago) has done nothing for me, I promise I have tried that route. I know that I am the problem. I need some resources for ME to work on this and model better reactions.\n\nIn the past couple weeks, since my child (5 M) started kindergarten at a new school, he has greatly increased his similarly poor reactions to minor things, but the new issue is his threatening other kids. He knows that threats are unacceptable. I've just learned that, at school, he's been trying to actually hurt other kids now when he gets upset. He has tried this with me before, and I have told him directly that it's ok to be mad, it's ok to be upset, it is NOT ok to hit people or use your hands, and that he needs to keep his hands away from others, and that he needs to say \"I am mad/upset/disappointed/frustrated because \\[reason\\].\" His teacher tries to redirect him and have a safe spot for him to move through his emotional response, which he eventually does, but it just takes a really long time. We are all explaining EVERYTHING to him. **He knows the expectations.**\n\nIn the past couple weeks, he has been acting particularly unpleasant, uncooperative, refusing to listen to basic instructions (hold my hand in this parking lot, timer's up and it's time to leave the playground, sit down and stop jumping on the couch bc you just jumped ON ME, please walk at the pool so you don't slip \\[result: he slipped and fell HARD on concrete. Did not care, got back up.\\]). \n\nYes, I follow through with the stated related/natural consequences (e.g., \"you will sit in the car until you calm down and you're ready to listen, and miss out on things if you don't listen to me to stay safe,\" and oh look, he has to sit in the car now. We have left playgrounds bc he will not stop doing something super dangerous. See also: please bring your water bottle home from school so we don't lose it for good). \n\nAnd, my reaction to his escalating refusals to listen have been... poor. I start out fine trying to keep it casual but authoritative, increasing to \"hey, I said \\[you have to XYZ\\],\" but by the fifth time I am BEGGING him to please do the thing, I just lose my sh!t and yell at him. \n\nOh, also, he does not do ANY of this with his dad (my husband), just me! (And yes, I am fully \"honored\" or whatever that he knows that I will love him regardless of his sh!t behavior, it's still not acceptable.)",

    "selftext": "From time to time, I’ll come across content like “let kids be kids! Your kid isn’t making it to the NHL, NFL, etc..”.\n\n“It’s all too overwhelming for the kids. It’s all too competitive” \n\nNow I seen a post saying that we SHOULDN’T be putting the kids in sports due to these reasons, and everyone in the comment section agreed saying “yes we should be having our kids play outside, have family time, and play with friends.” \n\nAnd I’m all for family time, but at the same time it confused me. What do they think the reason is behind putting kids into sports? I never put my kid in any sport with the imagination “he’s going to become a PRO! He’s going to make it to the ____!” \n\nNo. I come from a poor childhood and never had opportunity to join anything. I felt happy I could put my kid into things to keep him active and have fun. \n\nMy son (who is now 10 years old) was in karate for 4 years (twice a week) with soccer once a week. \nNow he’s looking into joining competitive soccer and leaving karate. \n\nI was also interested in putting him in piano maybe once a week. \n\nSo that would be two training sessions of soccer in the week, one game on the weekend, and maybe some piano lessons once a week sonewhere. WITH school as well. So maybe no piano but I do think it’s great for kids. \n\nBut now I’m feeling guilty especially after seeing these posts. \nNo, I don’t have expectations my son will become a pro. I honestly just want him to focus on school.\nIs that supposed to be the end goal for these sports?? That’s what some parents make it feel like. Like we are putting them in these sports with the idea of them making it big or being special. \n\nI just put him in there cause he likes playing soccer. I think it’s a good idea to stay active, and maybe make friends. \nI put him in karate cause I think martial arts are good for people, but I’m letting him leave because he feels done after 4 years and wants to try competitive soccer. \nI wanted to encourage some piano cause he loves music and I think it’s nice to have that knowledge and it builds IQ and focus. \n\nHe plays a TON outside. He has neighborhood friends and they play in the yard all day. \nWe do family trips and play video games together. We eat together every night and talk about everthing. He gets tons of sleep. \n\nBut I’m feeling a bit guilty after seeing some of those posts and everyone agreeing. \n\nYes, sometimes it all feels very busy and we’re on the go go go, but is that no ok? \nShould we hold off on piano or competitive soccer? Should he just do regular soccer (one day a week)? Is competitive only for those who want to be “pro” or for those parents who think that’s what their kid will be? Or is it for the kids that love soccer and want to play it more seriously and more often? \n",

She'll get so many birthday wishes from cast members and guests alike, she'll feel super special. And maybe, not guaranteed though, she'll get special treatment (like skipping a line for free) or a freebie.\n\n*About the party:* Did you ask her what she thinks? She could probably tell you if she even wanted a party. I as a child didn't mind skipping a birthday celebration if we traveled, even more so if it would have been for Disney. But not everyone is the same. If she hasn't had a birthday party in so long that she cannot even possibly remember you must know if she somehow has the expectation through friends or TV shows or books or if this is something she hasn't got on her mind at all.\n\nIf she really wants a party (and you not only want to be a good mom but an amazing one) you could make it really small? Just invite 3 or 4 friends for some pizza and play some games. The decorations would already be there if you plan on decorating anyway. I assume cake would be too?

    "title": "Conflicted on choice of preschool!",
    "selftext": "Looking for advice! My daughter (recently 3) was at the same daycare from \\~1.5 yo until early August, 3X a week. We really liked the daycare, particularly the director and assistant director (who was also our daughter's first teacher there and just wonderful with the transition from at home to daycare), but something came up with the Toddler 2 lead teacher. Specifically that there was ongoing conflict between her and the assistant teacher which  the director was very aware of and working on. In addition we learned some disturbing stuff about the lead teacher's husband - people's partners' views are not necessarily their own, but I can't imagine his beliefs aren't something he shares at home and she's still with him. We had always gotten kind of a \"weird\" vibe from this teacher and we ultimately made the decision to pull her from care and not have her move up to their preschool program because it was causing us so much stress.\n\nShe was home for about a month and during that time we toured another preschool (School A), as well as the former school's newly opened location (School B). School A did not have an immediate opening and put us on a waitlist, while School B did have an opening and my daughter started there this week. So far things are going well - the energy in the preschool room is good and while she had some normal tears at drop off today she's come home happy both days and I was feeling a lot of relief.\n\nHere's the issue. I just received an email from School A saying they now have a spot open and my daughter could start in a few weeks and is asking us to make a decision by tomorrow. My first gut feeling, the immediate feeling was to say \"no,\" but now I'm feeling conflicted and looking for thoughts/perspectives. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons of each by considerations:\n\n**Cost:** School A would allow us to have our daughter there 3X a week, which is a schedule that we really like, but we'd still have to have to pay for 5X a week, which wil end up being **$800 more a month**. We could swing it, but it's a lot of money!\n\n**Distance/commute:** School A would be a 20-25 minute drive each way. School B is only a 7 minute drive each way, which is obviously amazing.\n\n**Outside space:** School A has a massive playground and a school garden which is amazing. School B has just a smaller playground which is fine but obviously love having my daughter having space to run an play.\n\n**Curriculum:** School A definitely has a more defined curriculum and there's much more discussion of educational philosophy etc, but I don't doubt that my daughter would learn and grow at School B. She's a very smart and curious child and at 3 I'm also not overly concerned with learning, with a capital \"L\" - I do believe that at this age play and learning to be a good citizen of the world by interacting with other people should take precedence.\n\n**Vibe:** School A largely caters to a local university's faculty.students so there is a lot of cultural diversity since these families come from all over, but my sense is that there is significantly less SES diversity. A good friend's son who previously attended my daughter's first preschool just started at School A and has communicated that the style is a bit less \"warm\" and more focused on independence (for example: asking how her son likes to be comforted and when she explained that at home it's hugs and cuddles they said \"we have a calm down corner for children to self regulate in\"). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just a different approach. In addition, School A is a true preschool - only 3-4 year olds while School B is also a full daycare. While there is a preschool classroom they also care for infants and toddlers.\n\nSorry for this incredibly long post - I'm stressed!",

    "selftext": "I’m looking for advice on my daughter (almost 3y, only child).  I believe she is having night terrors but they seem to be happening during the day as well.  A little backstory- she is terrified of bugs.  Terrified.  Any and all bugs.  I fully blame myself for passing that fear on to her as she has definitely seen my reactions to bugs, bees, etc.  I’ve been trying to be more mindful and remind her that bugs are nice and they have the right to be here just like we do.  \n\nTwo days ago, she went to go get onto her bike and I heard her start screaming bloody murder.  Turns out, a wasp was on her handlebars and it stung her pinky finger.  I stayed calm, picked her up & brought her inside.  We put an ice pack on it and a bandaid (no stinger visible) and I gave her a snack and she was good to go.  She continued to talk about it though.  For example, when my SO got home from work the first thing she told him was how a bee stung her and that it wasn’t very nice.  SO told her it was probably an accident and that the bee just got scared when she put her hands on top of him and that the bee was just protecting itself.  \n\nUnrelated but we recently got her a toddler tent with an air mattress for when we go camping.  We set it up in her bedroom a couple of nights ago hoping she could sleep in it here and get used to it before we go camping.  The first night, she did GREAT.  Slept all night in it, told us she loved it and wanted to sleep in it again tonight (last night).  \n\nWe put her to bed as usual, asked her if she wanted to sleep in her crib or in her tent, she chose her tent.   I read her favorite book, we rocked and talked as usual and I laid her in her tent.  \n\nJust as I’m starting to doze off, I hear her start SCREAMING like I’ve never heard before.  We went bolting into her room to find her swatting her face and hair still screaming.  She was saying “there’s a bee!! There’s a bee in here!”  We took her out immediately, my SO checked the entire tent, took everything out, etc.  Nothing.  No bees.  We finally got her calmed down, told her everything was okay and back to bed she went.  Not even 5 minutes later, same thing.  We go back in there, this time she said there were ants crawling on her.  Checked the tent, same thing. Nothing.  \n\nI calmed her down, we rocked in the rocking chair and I planned on rocking her to sleep then putting her in her crib instead.  As I’m rocking her & she’s dozing off, all of a sudden she scrunches up her eyes and starts swatting her face again and crying screaming saying there’s ants/bugs on her.  I told her there’s no bugs and she might just be having a bad dream.  She was clearly visibly distraught so we went downstairs to the living room and made a comfy sleep spot on the couch.  She had a hard time falling asleep but she finally did and there were no more episodes.  \n\nThis morning, I’m getting ready for the day and as I’m in the shower, I hear the same scream coming from the living room.  She comes running into the bathroom crying saying there’s ants on the couch.  I told her to stay with me in the bathroom and let me quickly finish and then we can go look together.  we walked out to the living room and I asked her where they were.  She pointed to the couch and said right here.  Nothing.  I decided to get creative so I found an old spray bottle, filled it with water and told her it was magic bug spray to keep them away so we misted the living room, the couch, her bed, basically anywhere she wanted to spray it.  She wanted to spray our cat too but I said no 😆.  \n\nLast night, I was sure that she was having a nightmare/night terror but since she is also having episodes during the day, I’m concerned.  Has anyone dealt with anything like this before? Thoughts? Advice?  I have a call into her ped just to ask for their opinion, but I have a feeling they will say it’s normal for her age but I just want to know how to help her, she was so upset and it broke my heart.  My mom and SO think the bee sting really messed her up, and it gave her a valid reason to be afraid of bugs because one hurt her.  I don’t know, sorry for rambling.  I am sleep deprived and worried.  TIA for any and all advice. \n\nTL;DR- toddler having nightmares/hallucinations that bugs are crawling on her, things around her when nothing is actually there. ",

While every child is obviously different, we couldn't even go in the room when my son was having terrors because we would become part of his hallucination and he would freak out.\n\n It sounds like your child is having nightmares that are waking her up, which is understandable after (what I would consider) a traumatic event for someone her age.

Sort of like what happens with sleep paralysis only they’re able to move around. \n\nI’m not sure if there’s a “typical” form of night terrors but I’ll tell you what we deal with to give you an idea. My son will be fine most nights. But at least a few times a month we’ll all be sleeping and all of a sudden the worst screaming you can ever imagine rips you out of sleep. It sounds like someone’s dying or fighting for their life. Guttural, primal screaming. \n\nSo we get up and go check on him. He’ll be in his bed screaming and screaming. Yelling “no” or calling for mommy or daddy. But you can’t interact with him really because he’s still sleeping. The more you do that, the worse it gets and the longer he’ll be like that. He usually gets up and moves around screaming or rolling on the floor…stuff like that. If we do try and calm him down and gently say, “it’s ok we’re here” he’ll scream even louder while looking right at us. So you mostly just stand there and wait. One of us will go back and soothe the other kids. \n\nAfter anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes or so it’s starts to get a little more quiet. He’ll fall back asleep and maybe jump back up again and scream for me while he’s looking right at me. But again, can’t really do anything but stare back and wait. Finally he’ll calm down and fall asleep. He never says anything more than that while he’s in it so I don’t know what he’s dreaming about that sets it off. \n\nAnd of course, because it’s a dream (even though from all appearances he’s wide awake) he has no memory of it the next day. You can ask him what happened last night and he’ll look at you all confused and say, “what do you mean?”\n\nSo that’s a night terror. If your daughter remembers being woken up by her dream and she doesn’t scream for 15 minutes straight, she’s more than likely just having nightmares.",

My son just wants sandwich pepperonis (No bread), Doritos or crackers, applesauce, & maybe peanuts or something else.

When I asked why & where is that in the policy they became annoyed & said “We follow the USDA healthy schools lunch guidelines & soda makes a mess.” \nMy reply was that’s fine that the school follows that guideline & procedure except that doesn’t apply to homemade packed lunches. I also explained that they only eat certain things & most things are hot foods & something I’ve cooked. I then looked at the school lunch menu & the Al la carte menu has chips, cookies, ice cream & some other snacks on it. So, what is wrong with what I’m putting in their lunch if they can buy junk anyway? \n\nTo add to this I found out you’re not even allowed to bring them anything at lunch.

    "selftext": "Edit 2: The response from the other mom was so wonderful. ❤️ It really opened the door for some honest conversation and sharing of support. She was grateful I told her and assured me this is something they want to address with their son. Thank you so much for all your responses! They really were so helpful. \n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your kind and wise advice. So helpful to get some outside perspective on these things. I did go ahead and send the message and am hoping it doesn’t cause any major awkwardness. I agree with what several of you said: if it were my kid, I would want to know. 🤷‍♀️ \n\nOriginal post: I’ll try to keep this short… my son (8) had a best friend (9) who lives a couple doors down. They spent the better part of a year running back and forth between each other’s houses. The 9 year old recently became friends with some ten year olds in the neighborhood, and the whole dynamic shifted. My son desperately wants to be part of the group and tries to fit in, but all they ever seem to do is pick on him. It’s been a slow slide all summer, but I feel like we’re in bullying territory now. They sent some mean spirited messages to my son on his watch phone out of the blue yesterday (telling him he’s not cool, telling him to come over and play but they weren’t really at that location, sending messages of nothing but laughing, etc.) A couple times, they walked by our house, saw my son, and screamed “it’s him!! Run!!!” And then ran away laughing. In recent weeks, I heard the former best friend tell my son that he didn’t want to play in our “stupid ugly house” and another kid tell my son he’s “a loser who no one really wants to play with” while the others stood on smirking. My son spent the better part of yesterday sad and hurting. \n\nThe question: Do I tell the neighbor boy’s parents? I only know the parents of the former best friend, not the other kids. We’re friendly but not friends. Below is the message I’m thinking of sending. (Names changed of course.)\n\n“Hey Sarah - I wanted to let you know we had a bit of a tough day yesterday. Henry (and I think Hunter) sent some mean spirited messages to Anthony out of the blue on his watch phone. A group also walked by our house a couple times and if they saw Anthony, they would scream “There he is! Run!!” And all run away laughing. This is coming after a couple weeks of me hearing them say several mean things to him when they didn’t realize I was listening. It’s starting to feel like it’s drifted from normal kid squabbles into more targeted bullying. It seems that they don’t want to play with Anthony, which I will help him navigate. But if you could talk with Henry about giving Anthony some space, that would be helpful. Anthony has asked to remove Henry from his watch phone list and I’ve told him not to chase the neighborhood kids around anymore unless they explicitly say they want to play and are being kind.”",

The school freaked because we shared all the reasons with the district, including a certified letter from his therapist as to what the bullying was doing to him, and his test scores are through the roof. They tried to talk us out of it, we gave them the finger on the way out.\n\n\nHe's had the most amazing month at his new school, and it was the best thing we could have done. \n\nIf we'd had the ability to talk to the parents, we'd have done that 100%, so I think you reaching out is a great first step.

Then today after school he came home and said he had a girlfriend and my husbands first thing he said was oh did you kiss her and I about lost my mind.

Should I sit him down and explain that when people say boyfriend and girlfriend they are talking about someone who you like and want to hold hands with/be around a lot. I can explain that it’s usually grown ups who have bfs/gfs and when adults ask about that they are just being silly because kids don’t have real relationships. This whole thing is just really upsetting to me maybe I’m being dramatic 😂 \n\nI had a bf in kindergarten and specifically remember everyone asking about my bfs. Then I spent the next 20 years trying to get boyfriends and revolving my life around them and tying whether or not I had a boyfriend to my own worth. Maybe I wouldn’t of done that if my dad wouldn’t have always joked about me having boyfriends and bragging about it to his friends like it was cool his daughter was growing up.

Young kids sometimes pretend to be boyfriends or girlfriends or being married, but it isn't until someone grows up to being at least a teenager that they will have a real boyfriend or girlfriend. \n\nThen I repeated what I'd already said about hugging and kissing other people and making sure to ask first.\n\nIn my case though no one was asking my kid if she had any boyfriends! It came up instead because she said she wanted to marry me so I was explaining how all that often works. I agree that for you, it would be good to add that grown ups sometimes make jokes about it but they know that young kids don't have real bfs/gfs.",

    "title": "4 year old doesn't listen, and not in the following directions sense of things",
    "selftext": "I'm worried about my 4 year old due to what I think might be atypical behavior. My daughter doesn't look at us when we talk to her, most of the time. It isn't like she never does, but when we're asking her something or trying to explain something it's like it is very hard for her to focus and listen. She often has responded to us and others by saying things that aren't on topic. Like she just blurts out what is on her mind. Again, with repeating and prompting she will answer the question or repeat what we're telling her to say, like 'Jane, please say hi to Mrs. Smith\"...\n\nA real life example from today's meet the teacher event, her new teacher said \"Hi Jane (not her real name)! Are you excited for school?\" And her response was \"Buddha is in the car!\" Her stuffed animal that I wouldn't let her bring inside. It's like she's not paying attention to social cues and conversation. I'm constantly having to redirect her in social situations.\n\nShe had preschool last year 3 days a week so it isn't like it is an unfamiliar setting, we also attended church there weekly.\n\nWhen people introduce themselves or another kid says hi to her, she often doesn't respond, I have to direct her by saying, \"Jane, so and so is speaking to you, say Hi Sam, and she will quick look up and say 'Hi Sam' and then go back to looking away or whatever she was figeting with.\n\nShe seems to be okay with her cousins, who are older. But it isn't very conversational, more like statement speaking and mostly they're running around playing hide and seek or chase or something physical. Not sitting at the table talking. \n\n We had a speech evaluation done last year after parent teacher conferences and it was brought to our attention that she was repeating herself- a simple questionnaire starting with what's your name, how old are you, etc. Then when asked what's your favorite TV show, and where do you live, she either didn't understand or know the answer, because she repeated 'my name is Jane' and 'i am 3 years old' for those questions. She also gave answers related to what she had just been doing- what's your favorite activity with your family? Grocery shopping - she had been playing grocery store in the classroom, what's your favorite food? Eggs. She was specifically playing grocery store and with the eggs, the teacher told me.\n\nThe speech evaluation came back fine for 3, the evaluator didn't have concerns since Jane was using the right context, plurals, ing etc. and also answering questions one on one perfectly normal. The lady said if after 4 you have concerns let's do an in class eval, as the bar is set much higher at 4. She turned 4 the last day of school! So I filled in her new teacher with my concerns and once we're back in the routine of things, if her new teacher notices anything off she is going to reach out and let me know so we can arrange the in class evaluation.\n\nOur preschool teacher last year kept me in the loop for the rest of the year. Jane is soft spoken and will answer 1 on 1 or when directly asked but never participates in a group shout out the answer kind of thing. I noticed at their holiday performance she wasn't singing along or doing the hand motions and stuff. But she will do that sort of thing at home. As I reread this post it sounds like \"oh she is shy!\" But I guess in my gut I worry it's more than that. Especially because my gut about something being wrong with my younger son, was confirmed. He was diagnosed back in March.\n\nI guess I am wondering what is \"normal\" for being shy and what is a cause for worry about things like attention and focus issues, neurodivergent social issues- her little brother is level 2 so I'm hyper focused on anything being 'off' to make sure we don't miss anything and she gets support if needed.\n\nAre/were most of your 4 year olds having conversations and paying attention to adults and/or other children enough to go back and forth on their own? Again it isn't 100% of the time but it is enough to have me worried. At a church pot luck last Sunday, a child who was kust over 3 was telling me her favorite Disney princesses and things she remembered from the beach this past summer. On her own, unprompted. My daughter has never spoken like this. And no that child didn't have any older siblings. It makes my heart hurt to think she could be behind and hindered from making friends if she can't keep up socially.\n\nAny similar stories, advice, what have you, I'd love to hear. Thank you<3",

It's pretty rude and reckless behaviour especially when he's out with 78 yr old grandma because his favourite thing to do is to step on his chaperone's feet mid stride as well as hold his bag arms outstretched and twirl in circles.

He also has trouble focusing on his favourite movies for more than 30 minutes so he's \"bored\" all the time. \n\nI know their brains aren't fully developed at this age but it's still quite worrying as I was quite the opposite.

I don’t want to wish the time away but I really am looking forward to when he’s bigger and hopefully easier to settle and be comforted. ",

So he’s a teenager, almost 19. \nHe doesn’t mistreat his peers, however he does get into fights in school. \nHe fights with us as well. By fighting i mean he’s brutally honest with people, he doesn’t shy away from saying something. The way i see it, he’s strong minded and opinionated. \nHe hates studying and school. Like he likes sports and artistic stuff. But math and history don’t get into his head. \nHe has also smoked pot and drinks with his peers from time to time. \nI was telling my wife that i don’t like his partying habits, but im not one of those parents who would want their child to be a yes man or be a pushover. \nEsp when he starts dating as he gets older and deals with difficult people and situations, his confrontational attitude is not gonna be so negative. I think people just perceive it that way. So does my wife. She wants him to be what i would describe in a way, timid. She says well behaved. \nI also said that if he doesn’t want to study the usual subjects, he can find something rhat he likes doing and that might pay him well in the future. \nShe begs to differ. \nApart from the partying i support my son. I think his argumentative nature is not inherently bad behaviour as long as he is not bullying someone or something like that. \nMy wife compares him to other classmates who are more well behaved and are more reserved. \nI personally think he can be good at design and architecture. \nWhat say you?",

She does not listen, she talks back, she whines & yells, she has issues in school (talking in class & interrupting). Tonight we did our bedtime routine. I told her to wash up, go to the bathroom, put pj’s on, grab a snack & a water so she can get to sleep. She finishes her snack, goes in the kitchen to grab a juice. I told her no juice, just water because it’s so late & we’ve talked about how juice isn’t a good option before bed because of the sugar. She stomped her feet on the floor, upset because “it’s not fair.” So I sent her to bed, with nothing. I’ve tried so many different things over the years. Making different types of charts (chore charts, reward charts, charts for evening schedules, etc) I’ve taken away toys, grounded her, taken away electronics, offered positive rewards/reinforcements, I’ve read & read on how to do things differently ex: letting her have choices- do you want to do your homework/shower/clean up now or in 10 minutes? & nothing is working. Her dad is not really involved in her life (his choice), but our life is stable. I make decent money, we’ve lived in the same place since she was 2.5, I’ve been with my SO for 3 years. I did recently have a baby in May, but these issues have been going on long before I was pregnant. I’ll admit - I am at fault. She’s extremely spoiled & gets everything she wants all the time. I just wanted her to have what I didn’t have growing up but I fear that I have really messed up. I don’t know what else to do, I’ll take any advice. I have a feeling she is “neurospicy” but the evaluation has determined that she is not. ",

They are just rejecting information for the sake of rejecting it because you’re about to enter a major ego formation stage.\n\nTherefore, if they are behaving too compliant, that’s actually ABNORMAL and could be a sign of repressing emotions, or not feeling confident to be themselves in the home.\n\nThey just SUCK at making decisions because it’s so hard for them to think beyond instant gratification - especially in our times with algorithms designed to do exactly that. \n\nSo seeing it as a “how can I help this child improve the way they think about getting what they want out of life” has been so emotionally freeing. \n\nIt’s almost like just seeing a machine malfunctioning. You just tinker until it starts to work.\n\n\nAnd in that light, here are two ways I found effective in helping my kiddos think beyond the immediate reaction. \n\n1 - Ask them “do you think that this behavior is going to make me want to give you what you want?”\n\nThis is what’s called “forced empathy”. You are framing them to have to think about how you feel and what you desire, but still in the context of what they want. \n\nThis is super powerful. Done long enough, it will click. The key here is the “instant reset”. The moment they behave in the manner that you want, reward it. \n\n2 - Make them Write\nThere is no difference between writing and thinking. So when you make them answer questions and essentially psychoanalyze the situation and themselves, you train their brain to do it in the future. \n\nBe RUTHLESS in the writing clarity. Not in a mean way, but make them do it again and again until the writing is clear and concise. \n\nAs they get older, pair this with books. Make them read a book and then tell them how to write an essay about the key take away and how they could have applied it in the situation. \n\nHope this helps!\n\nBest of luck!",

I think the thing that’s helped me the most is reminding myself that this is just a part of her development. When you find yourself getting overwhelmed just try to take a moment to get some deep breaths. Calm your mind a little bit and speak calmly but firmly when giving instructions or reprimanding. I think the best thing you can do is be consistent. If you are doing punishments, do them consistently. If you are taking away toys/activities, make sure she understands that her thoughts and actions have consequences. This is crucial to get ahead of this now before she gets older and tries to push the envelope even further. I would even go so far as to adding in some type of community service.

Go get some ice cream. Get a treat from the gas station. It’s the little things. I used to love when my mom would pick me up as a kid and surprise me with things like this. He’s a little boy, so I guarantee you even just bringing him to a gas station and letting him pick out a treat will be exciting for him. Even if it’s a small one. Going to school or nursery or whatever, for a young child, can be stressful at first because the child has been with you every second of every day up until these moments. \n\nTell him “okay, buddy. I know you’re scared for mommy to leave you at nursery but I need you to be a good boy. If you be a good boy, mommy will bring you to get ice cream together after I pick you up”. Positive reinforcement is key here for young minds.

At the time, I couldn’t understand why he had suddenly become so cold and distant. He stopped helping with the baby and basically left me to do everything alone. I thought he was struggling with mental health, but the truth was he had another woman.\n\nWhen I finally found out, he cried and swore it was over with her. Days later, he asked me to take our baby and go stay at my parents’ so he could “be alone.” Instead, he went back to her. Since then, it’s been nothing but lies, empty promises, and him choosing her over us.\n\nI’m raising our daughter basically on my own, while he comes in and out of her life. He’ll visit, say he misses me, apologize, and talk about wanting to “fix our family” — but then he goes right back to her. I know I shouldn’t even consider going back, but sometimes I’m so lonely and hurt that I’m tempted. I miss the idea of us being a family, even though I know the reality was him abandoning me and our baby.\n\nI guess I’m just struggling. I want my daughter to grow up with stability and love, and I don’t want to model a toxic relationship for her. I know logically we deserve so much better than a man who lies, cheats, and runs from responsibility. But emotionally, it’s hard.\nFor those of you who have been through something similar — how did you find strength and move forward as a single parent? How do you let go of the fantasy of a perfect family and embrace building a healthier life for your child instead?",

    "selftext": "As the title says, my kid (2 y/o this month) bit another toddler in daycare today. This is the fourth time it's happened. The first time was nearing 2 months ago, and daycare told us right away, sent an incident report, all that. The second time it happened was a couple weeks later. Daycare told us in person during pick up; saying that my child was having a hard time sharing, screamed, hit, fought his nap, and had bit again. The next day at pick up, daycare gave me a letter that said he had bit again and laid out the incidents of that day and the day before, saying we had one month to see improvement or he would be terminated from the program.\n\nI totally understand the provider's worries. My kid was constantly bitten at his last daycare (part of the reason we switched) and it was so hard to know that someone hurt my baby when I couldnt help him. If I were in the daycare's shoes, I would want to be strict with biting too. Knowing that, I took this very seriously. My S/O and I came up with a plan to address behaviors at home better, to make our child share more at home, we got him exposed to more toddlers his age at play dates, and even asked all our extended family to be firm when they noticed he threw a fit or refused to share with them too.\n\nMy child made marked improvements in the month that his since passed! As far as I was aware, there had not been any more behaviors or biting at daycare, my S/O and I even made efforts to check in with the provider every day to see if anything had occurred or if we needed to take him home early, always met with \"no, he's having a great day! :)\". I felt confident that we would make it through the month's probation bite free and he would be allowed to stay. \n\n...until today. I got the message that my child bit for the fourth time and my heart sank:\n\"This seemed unprovoked and your child was having a great day up until this moment, also all week we haven't had any unusual melt downs or incidents like this. However it does concern me that he wants to bite when angry or doesn't get what he wants especially since  an infant will be joining daycare tomorrow. At some point I have to stop allowing this in my daycare and the next time your child bites another child I will provide a letter of termination.\"\n\nSince this is the anonymous internet, I have to admit that I don't agree with the provider on this. Yes, I understand that biting is bad, but after working directly with the provider, working at home, and seeing serious improvements, I feel sort of shocked that this incident is the last straw. I see it as a slip-up of course, but to after nearly 4 weeks with no issues, I expected a little more grace about it. \n\nI also feel hurt personally. I've made a lot of effort to correct these behaviors, and I genuinely don't think I'm raising a bad kid. For the most part, he's very happy, curious, funny, and even polite. Yes, he has meltdowns when he doesn't get what he wants, but don't all almost-two years olds?? Does this punishment fit the crime of being an emotionally immature toddler? I feel like I've been very neutral and put in a lot of work to try to fix this situation. That's why I need your help: am I being too biased by taking my child's side here? Does an almost 2 year old deserve termination for 4 biting instances over 2 months?",

The straw that is breaking the camels back here is the biting others several times and it becoming a safeguarding issue at this point.\n\nYour kid isn't a bad kid and I'm going to assume you are not a bad parent considering you are actively trying to improve the behavioural issues but there has to be a line drawn on what others (either caregivers, other kids, other parents) should be expected to tolerate and, in my opinion, this is way past that line.\n\nDon't take it personally because it's not personal.

My daughter (2yo) is very calm & listens really well so I don’t yell at her, but I understand that having 8 of them is a different situation. \n\nAll I heard was the teacher yell “no ma’am” super loud and then my daughter started crying and she was cradling her arm.

I’ve never known her to be dramatic or whiney so it really alarmed me. \n\nI do hear them yelling a lot at the other kids (even in the baby room) and the other parents seem fine with it so I guess that’s just the way things are here. \n\nThis is the 2nd daycare I’ve tried here, the last one I pulled her out of bc she started shaking her dolls and yelling “shut up go to sleep” & it freaked me out.

My son is 4 and he is in TK (Transition Kindergarten) it’s a new Grade Level they added in our district, not sure how common it is other places. \n\nMy son has BIG feelings. Since he came out of the womb, he has had big feelings. He is an incredibly strong willed kid. It’s been extremely hard parenting him. My husband and I try our best, and I do believe we are great parents. But, goodness, it’s hard. He had a few bad days when he first started school, but last week he had four GREAT days in a row. His teacher was very impressed and happy. Well he went back today and it was terrible. I mean really BAD. He was told it was time to switch stations, he didn’t want to. He told his teacher and her aid “no” when they told him he had to, he completely lost control and become “aggressive” (words they used) he slapped the aid in the stomach and told her he was going to “kill her”… I have NEVER heard those words come out of son’s mouth. Never. We do not use words like that in our household and when I found all of this out, I burst into tears. I really don’t know what to do. Punishments don’t seem to work. We have tried spanking in the past, when things got really bad. But my husband and I have both decided we will never use that form of punishment again. Taking things away doesn’t work, talking gently doesn’t work, it seems like NOTHING WORKS. When he feels a big emotion, he FEELS it. It’s like he sees black and all of the progress we have made was all for nothing. \n\n\nMy son is amazing in SOOOO many ways. He’s funny, so smart, kind, silly, sweet, and his smile could light up an entire room. He greets all his friends with a wave and smile every morning when we get to school. He hugs his teacher when he sees her. He’s EXCITED for school. He likes school. \n\nThis whole situation is breaking me. As a mom, I feel embarrassed that MY son is becoming the “bad” kid in class. I remember the bad kid from school. We all remember who the bad kid was in school. I do not want that to be my son. Because he’s not bad. 😢 I don’t know what else to do besides ask other people for help and advice. I’m embarrassed to even be posting this. I wish I didn’t have to. But I’m reaching a breaking point. I love my son more than anything in this world, but he is making me feel a way towards him that I do not want to feel. How do I make this better? How do I help him? ",

        "body": "Something that was happening with one of my kids...they were constantly bringing up these things my child was doing that seemed *very* out of character. And this was my third kid. I'm fully aware there are no angel children that are perfect. I also knew my kid and if she was \"threatening\" someone w/ a stick or pushed a child...**something** happened just before that. They insisted these things were happening out of the blue. She launched herself at a child, unprompted and tackled them, etc. \n\nThey started to kind of do this thing like...obviously something at home was going on, what we were doing at home that would prompt this behavior or encourage my child to use physical force on another student??\n\nSo I turned it around on them. \"This isn't behavior we typically experience at home - what could be happening in the classroom to cause this?\" How does the teacher speak to my child? How do the other students speak to her? Is something happening on the bus to increase her irritability by the time she gets to the classroom? \n\nAnd then I talked to my older child - who they did not realize was related to us (same last name & address... and even though I said before there were no angel children, my middle kid at this age was about as angelic as you could get for a kid). So one day during one of the MANY conferences I had to attend over my child's behavior I said, \"Can someone call my other student down to the office, please?\" When I told them her name they were like, \"That's ***your*** child? **YOU** are her mother?\" Yeah. I'm the child of everyone's favorite student and least favorite student at the same time. Go get her. \n\nThen my almost-an-angel child started to detail all the crap that had been happening on the bus, happening in the cafeteria when they ate breakfast, and happening on the way to her dropping her little sister off at her class every day. There was a girl on the bus that was antagonizing my [already impulsive] child relentlessly. But big sister could hold her back and remind her of the rules. As soon as big sister was out of sight and any time the teachers were not keeping a close eye - my child was giving into those impulses. \n\nThe stick incident was b/c she'd already been getting poked with a pencil by the other girl. The push was to keep her away from another student w/ scissors. The launch-tackle was b/c the girl spilled syrup from breakfast on my child and she knew the best way to \"pay that back\" was by rubbing her clothes up against the mean girl. They kept making a big deal that my 5YO was about 20 pounds and 6 inches bigger than the other kid...but their birthdays were within a week of each other, so they were near the same age. I can't help it that the weakest-bodied kid in school chose a mini-linebacker to bully. \n\nLike, was my kid wrong. She should not physically attack another child. At the same time, it sounded like she was already resisting urges to do that over the course of ALL DAY. So I was proud that she was only getting in trouble for \"failing\" twice a week or so. B/c the bus was a separate thing she was pulled from the bus and my kid started having much better days overall. And the teacher separated them in class and kept a closer eye. Suddenly my never-an-angel child was one of the \"most improved\" students in class. \n\nSorry this was so long - but talk to the teacher. Find out what is happening before he snaps.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I'm an early 30s father of a 2yo. My daughter has lots of energy and loves exploring so we go to the park a lot and play together.\n\nBecause she is only 2 I stay with her when she climbs, etc. because she is pretty bold. I trust her, but one slip at her age could be pretty bad. Anyway, when we play together at the park, I help her climb (support but let her do the work of figuring out what to do) and play little games together. Very interactive.\n\nHere's where my question comes in, it's not about her, it's about other kids. What seems to happen semi frequently is slightly older children (4-6) who are semi/fully unsupervised will gravitate towards us and start \"showing off\" or keep trying to engage in attention seeking behavior with *me*. My daughter is very social and loves to say hi to new friends. If she expresses interest in another child around her age we will go over together and introduce ourselves to the parent and child.\n\nMy issue is when these children engage with us, without a parent, and specifically seek attention from me, the adult. If they play with my daughter it's fine, but I don't know what to do when they focus on me. I can't really focus on them, because I'm playing with my daughter, but feel bad ignoring them too. I also feel uncomfortable being put in a position of perceived responsibility over their behavior and actions. \n\nThis is mostly a problem of not having their parent come over when they see their kid engaging with another adult, not for stranger danger reasons, just for awkness sake.\n\nAny advice on how to handle these situations?  Am I overreacting? It's nothing wrong with the kid, they love attention, I see it more as a parenting thing, but let me know your thoughts/experience.",

Well after him going insane the other night I decided I was done fighting him & told my husband to leave him alone as well i end up shutting the whole house down no lights on anywhere only a bit of light coming through the blinds. At first he didn’t like it for a couple minutes,then he ran into the room with my husband & went & laid down with him after 10 minutes or so without having another breakdown. So tonight after he took his bath & got lotioned up I did the same thing and turned everything off in the house & went to lay in his bed I told him it was sleepy time saying things like “I’m so sleepy” “goodnight” “i love you” “let’s lay down” & i can’t believe it but he didn’t cry not one bit he came to lay next to me after walking around in the dark for a few minutes & he eventually fell asleep took him about 30 minutes no crying no screaming no scratching or biting!!!!! I feel like super mom right now & im hopeful I will be able to keep this going throughout the rest of my pregnancy & not have anymore emotional rollercoasters 🤠 just sharing something I found out to help because these past few weeks have been hectic so if your toddler is anything like mines I suggest you try “shutting the whole house down” definitely if they know how to open doors I think that is helping him understand it’s time to call it day .

    "selftext": "Hello there, this is my first time posting here and i am just at a loss of how to handle these tantrums. \n\nA little background, my daughters dad and i split when she was a baby and she spends 75% of her time with me and 25% with her dad. She is used to this as it’s really all she’s known. Her dad and i both have life partners; so she has a step dad, my partner, and a step mom, her dad’s partner. \n\nMy (30f) daughter (10f) has a really tough time controlling her tone and emotions. It’s something we have been working on for a little while. She has started like pre puberty so i know emotions are on the rise and understand this comes with the territory of a tween. She is an absolute angel at school. Top student, has lots of friends, and is really a kind girl. Her teachers have always been so impressed with how focused and on task she is. I don’t know what changes once she gets home. Sometimes she’s wonderful at home, however, i would say at least once a day, she throws these wild tantrums. Like sprawled out, on the floor calling mom over and over again when I’m literally standing right next to her asking what’s going on. I keep my calm for longer than most, but it gets to a point where i start to lose my patience. Before we get to that point I do my best to help her work through whatever the issue is. Try to give her solutions. Tell her I’m so sorry she’s feeling whatever emotion it may be, I’m very empathetic. Nothing seems to console her and it feels like she just wants attention. This is hard for me to comprehend because her and my son both have my attention all day after school and on the weekends I have her. I take them to do fun things, we do play dates, go to the skate park, we are very active as a family. My partner is also very involved in this, he works at the kids school so he sees how wonderfully behaved she is there too. I just don’t understand where this is coming from. I don’t know how to help her navigate these tantrums. I’m tired and I feel like I’m failing. \n\nWhen does it get easier? Is this normal behavior for her age? How can i help her get better control over her emotions?",

    "selftext": "We have a relatively smaller living situation. My husband, two kids, and I live in a two bed/one bath apartment. It's about 900 square feet. Eventually my kids will need to share their room. For now my three year old son is in a toddler bed solo in his room at night while my three month old daughter is in a pack n play in our room. \n\nMy son is LOUD. His little feet pitter patter on our hardwoods, he yells at a base level volume, and is chaos in person form. I love him tons. He's so great with his sister, but man is it difficult to get a peaceful, quiet environment for her to sleep. Evenings are now the most challenging time since my daughter has started daycare this week and will be attending the same daycare as my son during the week. Trying to figure out how to balance bedtimes and both of their needs has been a huge juggle and I constantly feel like my daughter is overtired and not getting to sleep soon enough because it's a huge scramble every night.\n\nThe distance between the bedrooms and the bathroom is like 4 feet total...it's tight. So any noise from any of those rooms is heard in the other adjacent spaces. We do use white noise machines and tell our son to use soft voices, not to run, and to play quietly every night but his ability to remember that is limited.\n\nWe're tired. It's a lot to manage. And we don't have the ability to move somewhere bigger until we stop paying for daycare for my son in two years. We live in a HCOL area and pay $4770 a month for both daycares per month...it's insane. So we have to make this work for the time being.\n\nI need tips from others who have managed small space living with two young ones. Please help!",

One of my concerns is the schedule change, I've been trying to get him into bed earlier and up earlier, I haven't been super successful and I did start a little late. He has to be up at 630 am hes normally up around 8-9 am Reason being was I wasn't even sure that he was going this year because we had moved from a bigger city area to smaller town and I wasn't sure if they had a pre k but anyways . \nMy second worry/ concern whatever you may call it is that apparently this goes all day, I'm in NY and last I knew they only went half a day so that's a little bit of a shock. I'm nervous he's gonna be like I just wanna leave and he's going to hate it 😭 we had our open house tonight and he was just super overwhelmed. \nAnd my last main worry is the bus . He.forsnt get his own separate bus as far as I'm understanding and it goes up to 4th grade. I'm all for doing transportation in the morning , I just wouldn't be able to get him from school on Mondays and Fridays. They have an after school program but that's already a long day so idk about that. \nAnyways if you've read up to here I appreciate it . Mainly just looking for feedback, thoughts, experiences.

    "selftext": "Today was my son’s first day of kindergarten. It was an orientation day with kids and their parents. I signed him up for a dual-language immersion program where half the kids are supposed to be native English speakers learning Spanish, and half native Spanish speakers learning English. They switch languages daily and don’t repeat lessons.\n\nI chose this program because my son is very advanced in English and math (he’s already reading at a first-grade level), and I thought learning Spanish would challenge him in the right way. I also personally value Spanish — I speak fluently and I think Spanish in the U.S. is incredibly important.\n\nHere’s my concern: in his class of 25, almost all the kids are Latino and Spanish-speaking. It’s basically him and one other white kid. Instead of the “half and half” balance the program is supposed to have, he’s the minority racially and linguistically.\n\nAnother factor I didn’t realize until orientation: the kids in this program stay together all the way through elementary school (up until 7th grade or beyond). Aside from lunch, they aren’t integrated with the other 50–70% of students in the school. So this feels like more than just a classroom placement: it’s essentially a 7-year decision about his peer group and social environment.\n\nNow I don’t know what to do. Do I leave him where he is, or move him to a regular English class? There are 2–3 additional dual-language classes in the school, but I don’t know if the demographics are the same there.\n\nI want to bring this up with the principal, but I don’t even know how to start that conversation.

She goes to a really small school. She maybe has 62 kids in her grade currently. She has built many friendships but they all seem to fizzle out. There is one girl she was best friends with (we will call her E).. they've since stopped being friends and its causing issues. \"E\" is the kind of girl that thinks you cant be friends with people she doesn't like and if you are then you're against her. If she's talking badly about someone and you don't agree or join in the drama, you're the enemy. Which is why we are where we are.

I'm not here to say my daughter is a perfect angel, she's not. She doesn't pretend that everything is everyone else's fault. She owns up to her crap. \"E\"is trying to turn everyone against her and it seems to be working. Girls my daughter has been friends with, that werent friends with \"E\" are now friends with her and icing my daughter out. She says it's \"whatever\" and she isnt getting sucked into that kind of drama but I know it hurts her feelings that the kids she would hang out with or spend the night with are now turning against her just because one girl all of a sudden is mad at her. I've told her to just be her normal self, keep conversing normally with everyone and maybe the weirdness will fizzle out once \"E\" has accomplished what she wants and doesnt have anything to do with them anymore, which is exactly what will happen. I feel awful for her. Sometimes it really sucks living in such a small community. Is this a normal high school experience these days? I dont remember my HS being like this and it just makes me hurt for her. I know you usually dont find \"your people\" in high school but dang,  it'd be nice if everyone could just freaking get along.

It’s no way of getting her up. I have negotiated with her I have gentle parented. I have been stern and said come on let’s go. At school her teacher gives her red faces for those fits. So it’s not just me that’s like come on… mostly cause it’s embarrassing.. she does it at the gym, and the workers look at me like she must have a horrible time at home to be screaming like this. It’s honestly so embarrassing because I am a calm person and quiet. Very reserved. Like come on. I completely lost my shit today and didn’t even talk just grabbed her by her arm and exited. But of course the looks still carrying with me. It’s truly the most dramatic thing ever. I hate attention. She loves it. What are we even going to do? I feel like I’m turning into a mean mom cause I have to always be stern with her as she’s constantly getting in trouble even at school and says “cause I want to cause trouble” she hadn’t had consequences before at home that stuck or made her want to have better behavior until school started a couple weeks ago but now I try and it feels like it’s constant threats. I don’t want to threaten. I don’t want to raise children with fear. I don’t want to feel like a bad mom for saying “no” or the fear of turning into my parent hovering over me. God lord Jesus someone please just help a mom out with some words of wisdom. What can one even do when they don’t give a damn about consequences. I don’t like getting stern it breaks my heart I’m tired of threats, I don’t want to raise fear based children.

Lots of outdoor time and time they can decide what they want to do - field with a ball, cardboard and washable markers at home, other than school no activities with strict rules. Lots of swings, rolling in a heavy blanket. When giving directions, focusing on what’s important only and using way less words. Ask once, then calmly get up and “help” then do it. It’s exhausting. But with maturity (and meds) it gets better. Trick is to maintain an excellent relationship that isn’t just telling them what to do, correcting them or asking them to be quiet or stop moving. So make sure to limit those types of comments because no one wants to cooperate with someone they think doesn’t like them. Remaining calm and grounded which is the hardest and don’t set yourself up to be watched. We also found the saying - are they hungry, hangry, tired, lonely - sometimes literally taking some fruit and popping it in their mouths changed the attitude. You can get through this! How to talk so little kids will listen is a good short book. But Dr Barkley and other evidence based advice is necessary. Their brains have 30 tv screens at all times and a dopamine deficit. They often know what to do, but the link to doing it is broken so it always appears defiant. They don’t want to be bad, but they crave that dopamine. So school finding things that help will be useful - being involved for example - things to harness energy. You can do this!",

I’d probably talk to her about having to stay home because she can’t control herself in public and then dip my toe back into taking her out, but having a talk about expectations immediately before we go in- with the expectation that we will leave at the first sign she starts to de-compensate. On the reverse, I’d praise her for getting thru an activity without having a meltdown. \n\nI’d also really try and work on the school situation- I just can’t imagine being a teacher and having to deal with that daily. Is she getting over stimulated? Does she need some downtime and earplugs to help? Even though this one may cause you the least problem, it’s the one I’d be most concerned with fixing. Also, make sure that you’re being strong and consistent in standing up to her. Sometimes kids see that a fit gets to their parent and they give in to make it stop. Do everything you can to not give in to this pattern, just matter of fact take her and leave. Personally, I would tell the teacher every time she did it, I want to be called and pull her out of school and take her home. I’m sure after a few days she would correct her behavior (again, if socializing is important to her).",

Things have been extremely difficult financially for the last couple of years and long story short I’m now facing eviction (I got behind on the rent, a payment plan was arranged for the arrears and I missed three repayment instalments for the arrears.) I posted on Reddit for some advice and I’m absolutely devastated at some of the comments I got. I already suffer a lot from mum guilt because since my daughter was born I’ve had to juggle bringing her up alone with working and money has always been tight so she’s missed out on a lot of things people often take for granted. But she’s loved and well looked after and I know it’s a cliche but she’s my absolute world. Her needs have always been my first priority. \n\nAfter posting for some advice about the possible eviction, I’ve been getting lots of comments and DMs about how I’m a bad parent and I don’t know how to process this. People have accused me of neglecting my daughter because I’m a working mum, they’ve said she’d be better off with people who can provide for her properly. Someone even said people like me are the reason why people should have to apply to be parents. A few people have said I could lose my daughter if we’re made homeless and someone messaged me to say this will be a good thing for her because she’ll have a fresh start at life. I’m absolutely heartbroken by it. I know I messed up with the rent but it’s been so hard juggling all the bills with the price of everything going up. I’ve paid back 2/3rds of my rent arrears and the missed arrears instalments were because of  needing gas, electricity, food - not for any frivolous spending. \n\nI’m following up on some advice I was given about contacting Shelter, but I feel like everything is hopeless now and I’ve failed my daughter whatever happens. I don’t even know why I’m posting, I think I just need some emotional support but I also think I don’t deserve it now. I just feel like a failure. ",

But now there's SO much going around and targeting kids about having these ultra conservative values that are rooted in misogyny and racism.

My son is 16 months (a year and four months) and I adore him, but I wish he was my sibling instead of my son. Every time I look at him all I can feel is that my life has completely fallen apart, my body has been ruined, I failed my education (I dropped out of public school when I was 70% done with my 10th grade year), I've failed my family, and the terrible things his biological father made me go through (assaulted me, beat me, tried to crave his name into me, then tried to pressure me into getting an abortion [your body your choice but it's not available in my state] then wasn't there for the birth, and only saw my son twice in the 7 months he was alive outside of my womb). I know it's not his fault, it's mine, I didn't know plan b didn't work while I was ovulating and I didn't notice till after that my BD had poked holes in the condoms. I'm so exhausted having to wake up everyday and take care of another human being when I can barely take care of myself, let alone a child who is developing and taking constant note of my habits and coping skills. I have a wonderful support system (a great mother and father, as well as a set of grandparents who are happy to help) but they have their own issues and stuff to deal with seeing as I have two little siblings (m4 & f2). I don't know if I should talk to my obgyn about feeling like this because I don't want my son to get taken away from me, but I need help, and I'm unsure if this can still be counted as postpartum or not. \nAny insights or anything at all really are welcome, just please be kind about it.🩷",

    "selftext": "My daughter is having a difficult time doing (what I believe to be) age appropriate activities on her own. She has been doing gymnastics 1 hour a week for a year now, and she begged to do cheer at the same place, so we signed her up. I have stayed and watched all of her gymnastics and cheer practices so far. The whole practice she constantly checks for me like she thinks I’m going to disappear or something. I have never once left anywhere she was without telling her before we even get there. I’ve left early a few times for work, but my husband is always there before I leave, and she is aware before we get to practice, and I say bye when I go.\n\nCheer has turned from 1 hour a week, to 4 hours. 2 hours, twice a week. Today I mentioned I might sit in the car with our dog (he had been crated for most of the day today due to my appointments running late, and I didn’t want to put him back in because I felt guilty). I told her I would go back and forth between inside checking on her and out in the car with our dog, and she had a complete meltdown. She said to just cancel cheer then. \n\nAnother example is now she is old enough for the school bus to let her off without me waiting outside. The bus drops her off at the end of our driveway. We don’t have a long driveway, you can see the whole house and yard from the road. She got very anxious and cried when I said there would be times I won’t be waiting at the end of the driveway.\n\nShe is an only child, maybe this has something to do with it? She has no problems leaving us to go to school or a birthday party. \n\nAny tips or tricks? We want to support her and make sure she knows we love her and will always be there for her, but we also don’t want her being too scared to do things on her own as she gets older. ",

Then his friends got a PS5 too, they all shared their names and they play together. Some were allowed to play all day so I thought I could be a bit lenient and let him play for more than an hour (also had a baby around the time so the extra peace was nice) \n\nFor the past couple months it’s not been good… he has an attitude. I don’t know if it’s just 8yo boy retaliation or if it’s because of the PS5. I’m around when he plays it so I can hear what’s being said and sometimes his friends can be pretty vulgar, they’re allowed to swear too but my son knows that’s not allowed here. I’ll encourage him to come off if they’re all arguing (they all argue often about which game to play, who’s killed who etc) sometimes he will say XYZ is being mean to me, he told me he was going to XYZ, I pull the plug on it. \n\nIt’s the school holidays here and we’ve been spending the weekends away and really cutting the PS5 out during the week by doing other things but honestly I am tired and need a break sometimes. So he’s been on it this week. I’ve just had a parent message me that their kid is upset because of what my son said (absolutely fair) he had actually sent a message that it’s better not repeating, his dad went through his messages and he’s sent several different ones to each one and they’ve been awful “I’ll do XYZ to you” and swearing. \n\nI just want to bin the thing but his dad said they’re all as bad as each other he’s been told off. As soon as Dad said “what have you been sending because XXX’s mother has messaged me” he burst out crying, quickly turned his PlayStation off and ran out of his room. His dad argues that kids will be kids and he’s obviously tested the waters by the messages and knows it’s wrong because of his reaction but I’m ready to just stop it all together.\n\nAm I over reacting? What shall I change going forward? Do I go back to limiting it? School starts back tomorrow and when thinking about it I feel a bit guilty that after school they’ll all want to play and he won’t be able to but I don’t want my son to act like that. ",

However, I could use some pointers from who has had young toddlers. \nThing is, at 15 months old they are only starting to understand directions and a good portion of what we say, but it is not nearly enough yet to reason much with them, especially when they are in midst of a big tantrum.

Some of it was because the schedule of the day got a bit derailed, so she was overtired and off the rails, which I completely get, and I tried to comfort her, but she still had to eat and allow me to care for her to go to sleep. Should I just offer whatever she’ll take in big tantrums? Or is that being too permissive? I don’t want to encourage picky eating just to avoid big tantrums, as she is already not the greatest eater. \nI guess my question is : in this in between age where they have already big frustrations and big emotions/ tantrums, but are still not big enough for us to talk to them effectively, what is the best course of action to help less than good days?

        "body": "I have 1.5 year old daughter and this is how we do things. (*I have just realized I ended up writing a really long post. I hope some of it will be usefull to you.)\n\n\nWe try to have the same routine everyday when it comes to meals, nap time and bedtime, because anything else is a recipe for a difficulty or a complete disaster. Usually she always has food put in front before she gets ravenously hungry and is in bed before she is overtired. However, as you said, sometimes things happen that disrupt the routine.\n\n\nWhenever I suspect that my kid is having a tantrum or is getting moody because she's hungry or thirsty, I don't even try to address whatever triggered the tantrum but go straight to solving the problem, which is hunger or thirst. In practice that means that I give her or even directly \"stick into her mouth\" a piece of bread or a bite of a banana or something similarly simple, that is within reach. No matter where we are. Then I offer her some more and once her brain registers that eating is actually what she needs, she calms down enough that I can direct her to the table for a meal. \n\n\nIf she is tired but also hasn't had dinner yet, I first try to give her something to eat. If she doesn't seem interested in food at all, I try with something enticing. For example a bite of melon or a raspberry or some other fruit she likes very much. After that I offer her other food. If that doesn't seem to work, because she wants to skip dinner and go to sleep instead, I offer her some milk, so that she at least gets something nutritious that fills her up a bit and that she doesn't wake in the middle of the night because of hunger. Then I take her to bed. I wouldn't try to force a tired kid to stay awake, when they are already half asleep, unless there was literally no other choice.\n\n\nAnother tip: if your kid doesn't want to eat but you believe it might be time for a meal, give her something to drink first. Sometimes kids don't realise they are thirsty or won't drink (enough) while they are preoccupied with playing or running around.\n\n\nThe one thing that never works is trying to reason with a kid that is in the middle of a full-blown tantrum. Their brain is not receptive for it, they need to calm down a bit first. \n\n\nAnother thing I have noticed with my kid is, that when we come home after spending some time outside, she wants to have a few moments of peace/a few moments for herself before dinner. Giving her a few moments to cuddle with her favourite blanket or to play with some of her toys does wonders. She needs to just calm down a bit after the excitement of being outside before she is ready to eat. After that I can easily direct her towards the dining table.\n\n\nAnother things that seems to work well for us is that I always approach my daughter a few minutes before I want her to do something or go somewhere. I spend that time with her and let her finish whatever she's doing while gently telling her about what we'll be doing next. That way she's got time to process what is happening and is much more cooperative and calm during transitions from one activity to another.\n\n\nA different situation is when the tantrum is not related to a too quick transition or to her basic needs not being met. \n\n\nIn the situations where she is not allowed to do or have what she wants, I always:\n \n- immediately explain why we don't do something (very important and helps a lot!)\n- immediately show her what she is allowed to do instead (depending on the action/object)\n- if needed, I remove the object out of her sight and reach (out of sight, out of mind).  With toddlers aroind some things always need to be safely stowed out of their sight and reach. \n- try to redirect her to something else/show her something else interesting or similar which she is allowed to play with. ",

It's crazy that we're given a little human and then sent on our way to figure out on our own how to raise them. I wish parenting classes were the norm.\n\nI agree with you that the tablet needs to go. Or be much much much more supervised. No more taking it outside. I would say only allow it if you're able to sit behind her and watch what she's doing.\n\nI'd be careful trying to separate her from the best friend. That will just make her want to see them more. I don't know exactly what the issue with the friend is and trying to control who has influence over your child is so tricky. I personally just made sure my child was in a school that had more involved parents. I figured if the parents are involved then there's a higher chance of well behaved children that will surround my daughter. But other than that, I'm pretty open with my daughter and talk to her about everything that she may stumble across in the stage of life she's in. If a friend does something I don't like, I talk to her about how I didn't like the choice the friend made. (But try to not bash the friend) I know I can't completely control the environment so I have to prepare her to make the right choices when she's put to the test.\n\nOther than that, you'll mostly have to make some strict boundaries. Come up with consequences that are relevant to the behavior. Warn her what the consequences will be if she breaks the rules and follow through. She will fight hard and it's not going to be a quick change overnight. It's going to be tough but if you stick to your guns, eventually she'll learn what boundaries she can't cross. But also try to have good times together too. Find things you enjoy together and you can maybe get her to open up.

In addition to the obvious danger of her having free, unsupervised range of the house in the dark, im also concerned about the disruptions to her sleep patterns.  Short of locking her in from the outside, which we do not want to do because she's potty trained during the day and we are encouraging her to go at night (the toilet remains accessible on the other side of the baby gate), we have tried everything. Also, locking her in from the outside feels....idk. \n\nChild locks on the dooorknob? Absolutely 0 issue for her.\n\nBaby gates? She kicks them over or climbs them.\n\nWe have an alexa light in her room and tried the red/ green method. She fully understands the concept and it worked for maybe a week. But now it's just creepy red mood lighting as she gets up and begins her nighttime adventure.\n\nWe have had conversations with her about why its not safe- she usually goes to the kitchen and finds something to eat. We've told her that its dangerous to eat alone in the middle of the night without mom or dad, because what if she choked? We also told her that if she gets that hungry in the middle of the night she can wake us up and we will help her find a snack and go back to sleep. She has never woken us up.\n\nWe dropped her nap in an attempt to let her be extra tired so she will sleep through the night- sometimes this works! But she will still get up 3-5 nights out of the week.\n\nTonight/ this morning I am at an absolute breaking point. I woke up at 0500 to nurse my 1 year old and this is what I found:\n\nThe 3 year old walking to her room with an arm full of toys from the living room. Hands sticky and covered in something which turned out to be egg yolk. Yall, she took the step stool from her bathroom, carried it to the kitchen, got the eggs out of the fridge, and cracked half of them onto a plate!  She also feasted on leftover pizza, ice cream and a bad of baby carrots. Cool cool cool. At least her midnight snack included a vegetable. She is a GREAT eater and at a healthy weight. She always eats a good portion of her food at dinnertime and has a small snack before bedtime.\n\nBut here's the extra terrifying part of what happened tonight: she got a hold of TWO steak knives. We are in the process of moving into a new house and the knife block was on the counter, pushed allll the way to a back corner where I stupidly thought it was totally inaccessible to her. Shes not injured at all, thank goodness. But I'm in tears and just so sick to my stomach over it. \n\nWhen I discovered all of this, I washed her hands, sent her back to her room, told her she was in big trouble but we'd talk about it later. \n\nGuys... what do we do? What's an appropriate punishment in this situation? Should we really lock her in from the outside until the habit is broken? Can I set up a cartoon style net in the hallway to scoop her up into the air if she steps on it???  Is building a Rapunzel style tower my only option to stop my raccoon-like child from her night time foraging? Any ideas are appreciated. ",

She’s also seemed to regress with potty training, with which she was doing really well before Grammy and Grandpa moved in. She also wants me to do everything for her, which I try to do most of the time and am happy to do, but she yells “stop it, stop bothering me!!!!” To anyone (dad or Grammy) who are trying to help me with her OR her baby brother. I ask her if she needs some time to herself, and she always says no, but sometimes I’ll bring her upstairs away from everyone to calm down anyway, and that seems to help her. I assume most of these behaviors are due to the recent additions to our home, but not sure.\n\nI guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar, and what you did to best support your toddler? I feel like I’m failing her. I just don’t know what else to do.",

She doesn’t know how to say “I love these people but living with them is stressing me out.” \n\nBut, instead of thinking about it in the negative, think about it in the positive. We always learn the most in hard situations so she’s actually maturing a lot right now even though it doesn’t look like it to you. She’s learning about big, complicated feelings and is coping in her way. I’d try talking to her about how well she’s doing with the changes and you’re proud of her for wanting to do things on her own but it’s ok for adults to help too. I’d really focus on how awesome of a big sister she is since that’s the permanent change. \n\nWhen we visited my parents for the first time (they came and visited us a lot) my daughter was 4 and she did ok the first couple days then my aunt came to stay a couple days too (I live on west coast and family is east coast); my daughter was not kind to my aunt most of the time. I felt horrible cause I honestly don’t know when we’re going to see her again (she’s in her late eighties and I don’t make it east often) but kids aren’t going to behave the way we want them to, especially when changes happen. But my daughter does grow up a lot after big changes. \n\nYou’re doing great and your best, just remember that. Try to model good behavior even if it means you are ending up apologizing for losing your patience sometimes. It’s tough but you’ll get through it. (Also, she’s on her way to three and three/four seems to be more challenging for a lot of parents than two.)",

        "body": "Theres no evidence I can see from your post that this is the case, but something I read/heard somewhere once about second borns really stuck with me so Im going to share in case it is relevant. When a new baby is born, its common for parents to say things to the firstborn like, \"We have to leave the park now because its baby's nap time\" or \"I can play with you later, I need to feed the baby right now\" or \"We can't play that game because baby isnt old enough, lets find an activity we can all do together\". Basically its,  \"Your entire life and everything you know is now being disrupted by this new baby\", and firstborn hears, \"You USED to be the most important person to me, but now, baby is more important than you.\" So they hate the baby because that's the object that represents everything theyve lost. And the first step to fixing this is a simple change in words - \"Its time to leave the park now.\" \"I can play with you in 20 minutes, go set your timer! I'm so excited!\" \"Let's play this game you chose, while baby watches - then we'll play a game that baby likes.\" Another element of this is parents trying to force responsibility on firstborn, i.e. \"can you be my big helper and get x for baby? Lets be quiet so baby can nap, lets be good eaters so baby can learn how to be a good eater\" etc. And that can also cause resentment, something like it impedes on the firstborn's agency to just be a kid. The basic fix is, however this looks per family, \"stop treating your firstborn like a big sibling, and go back to treating them like theyre an only child that happens to share a house with another child\". So again idk if any of this is happening in your situation, its just the first thing that comes to mind when I hear about toddlers hating their younger siblings.",

    "selftext": "I just read a post on a different subreddit - the post was not about kids, but OP mentioned in it that her kids are homeschooled. Everyone in the comments latched onto that detail, and kept telling OP to 'stop isolating the kids'. \n\nI had positive experiences growing up in public school, but my brother was bullied quite badly, and had a hard time in school.\n\nMy daughter is still too young for school, but I've always been of the opinion that homeschooling would be more positive for kids, as long as they have recreational activities outside of the home with other children. \n\nSince school is a collection of random children from all walks of life, I feel that our children are more likely to be exposed to children from dysfunctional or abusive homes in school, which leads to bullying. \n\nHowever, with homeschooling, our child's exposure to other kids would mostly be in their recreational activities (music class, gymnastics, sports, or whatever else they're into) so they're going to have more positive experiences with like-minded children who share the same interests, and are productively working toward the same goals in their time spent together, as opposed to random interactions with kids at school during recess or lunch breaks. \n\nBeing around like-minded children working toward similar goals in shared activities is the better social practice to prepare them for adulthood, because it more closely mirrors the social dynamics they will experience in the workplace. As adults, we don't just stand in a park socializing with everyone, which is the dynamic kids are practicing at school 😂.\n\nLastly, I feel that parents who have their kids in productive recreational activities are more likely to be involved in their kids' lives and interests, so those kids are probably less likely to be dysfunctional / bullies. \n\nIn either dynamic, our children will befriend other kids, and opt to spend time with the kids they prefer outside of the school or recreational activities, so either way they will build real friendships over time. I am just thinking in terms of children spending time with large groups of children, and learning those initial social behaviours. \n\nIs my opinion an unpopular one, and why? \n\nEdited to add : \n\nBy \"all walks of life\" I didn't mean different cultures. I meant dysfunctional homes where parents have substance abuse issues, or are abusive. The homes that produce more bullies, are the homes where children are unhappy, and unfulfilled.\n\nIn terms of cultural diversity (at least where I live) recreational activities are full of every race and cultural background, it's not a \"white\" thing to sign your kids up for activities that they're interested in, and I have tons of friends who are POC and their children are very active in recreational activities and sports. \n\nI didn't mention cultural diversity in my original post because where we live, their exposure to different cultures, races and religious beliefs would be the same, regardless of whether they had access to other kids via the school system, or via recreational activities.

Let me give you an example here:\n\nMy daughter began kindergarten absolutely thrilled to ride the bus (“a giant yellow car without seatbelts?!”) A week in and she realized a social conundrum: two friends both wanted to sit with her, but only one could. She turned down one friend one day, but they were upset and she didn’t like that. So, she had to come up with a solution. \n\nThis sort of social troubleshooting is just one snippet of many tiny “conflicts” that occur. As adults, we make these sorts of decisions most days, but it’s a learned skill. Traditional schooling affords those learning opportunities where homeschooling would not.\n\nEmotionally, there are also many learning opportunities. Arguably, practicing independence is one of the big ones. Another example: \n\nYour child is in a new environment. She has to learn about her classroom, where things are kept, how the cafeteria functions. To go to the bathroom, she has to find her way there. Does she turn right? Which one does she go in? Does she trust herself to wash her hands properly? That inner dialogue of coaching herself through new situations *without you* is so important for emotional development. \n\nLastly, and the biggest one for me: are you *qualified*? Teachers go through rigorous education, ongoing certifications, training. Can you truly say that you’re qualified to not only teach every single subject and skill your child needs to know, but in a proven, didactic way?",

Adults absolutely have issues in work settings, friendships, college group projects, romantic relationships and platonic relationships.\n\nI would definitely not tolerate bullying but to isolate your kid from negative interactions is just unrealistic. How will they learn to navigate these situations other than being a pushover, imploder or worse. What if she meets a gaslighting a hole and thinks it's normal behavior?\n\nMore importantly to your point on friendships. Yes you can make great friendships and lasting ones in sports. Just harder in my opinion to do if those kids also see each other in the school setting, more time together, than just practice and games. Structured time with friends is great but unstructured time with friends is best.\n\n\nResilience is born from doing hard things and also do things with people you don't like. You're potentially removing the natural moments where resilience can be taught and fostered.  Self esteem, confidence, leadership etc. these are all part of handling negative interactions or feelings in a healthy manner.\n\nEither way do what works but I encourage you to rethink your stance on your child never having to be around people who disagree. No bullying but unfortunately the embarrassing, awkward, rude interactions also shape us.\n\nEdited to note that kids who do sports are not necessarily not bullies. The hazing that goes on in some sport groups (not all) the competitive nature can sometimes bring the negative out in other ways. Plus have you met a sports parent? Um the crowds at some of these events are absurd in terms of how some parents behave during competition.",

He then started getting a little whingy and winey from 1.5 and since he turned 2, he's completely the opposite. He's always whinging, always complaining, and never happy with anything. He's super stand-offish and takes a long time to warm up wherever we go. He's stubborn and has a fierce anger in him (which is odd because husband and I are calm and chill), he whinges all day long. \nIs this normal toddler behaviour?

    "selftext": "This has been a continuous frustrating situation for me 40m and my wife 36f. Our oldest son 5m has a habit of not responding when we're looking for him. I know he can hear us but he just doesn't seem to understand or care when he's playing that he needs to respond to us calling for him. This regularly happens when we are at family gatherings. Tonight, at a family get together we were searching for him again while he was playing hide and seek with his cousins when he couldn't be found. Me and my wife were calling out \"This is your daddy, we're not playing, come out now\" and he still hid from us. After searching the whole house several times I hear laughter in the other room and when I got to where he was about 10 adults including my wife were surrounding him laughing & he was very proud of himself. I was not amused at all because I was really worried about him after the extensive search. I also felt betrayed and annoyed at the adults that thought it was funny that he had been hiding from his parents and now encouraging his bad behavior. Of course, I have to be the bad guy now so I pick him up and ask why he didn't come out when his mommy and daddy were searching for him. His smile turned to a frown and got really quiet and the laughter stopped. He mumbles a few words under his breath and made an excuse that he thought we were someone else. I explain again that he needs to answer us when we are calling for him and put him down. I didn't give him time out or yell at him or anything but I feel like such an A-hole for coming in while everyone was having a good time and reprimanding my child.\n\nAm I wrong for doing this or were the other adults wrong for laughing and cheering when he was found? I feel like I failed as a parent and made myself look like a crazy person in front of everyone. But at the same time this is a regular occurrence and its very scary when your child goes missing like that. We can't find our son and no one seems to care. I feel like the other parents & adults around our family can be so unhelpful and I don't really know what to do and feel like I'm not handling this reoccurring situation well.",

My favourite is that I count and they hide like regular hide and seek, then I call out a silly word and from that point they have to try to sneak up to me or to a ‘home base’ without me noticing. I mainly use it so I don’t have to actively ‘play’ outside of counting and saying the word, but I wonder if you could try a similar thing around the house, and use the ‘silly word’ as a cue for your son to make himself known to you. If you treat it as a game, he may be more willing to reveal himself (by ‘sneaking’ to you) and it might be quicker than calling over and over. \n\nIt’s not the ideal solution as it doesn’t impart the importance of listening to Mum and Dad, but if it’s an ongoing issue it may be better than the alternative of him just not listening at all.",

    "selftext": "I am almost 31 weeks pregnant with my second son. My first is 4.5 and up until a couple of months ago, he was so happy about having a baby brother. In fact, even before I got pregnant, he would ask me about when we would become a family of four and specifically ask for a brother. But his behavior has changed a lot in the past few months and I am now very scared of the transition period once the baby is here. \n\nI know having a new sibling is a big transition for kids, so I was expecting him to regress once the baby is born, but to be honest, I didn’t expect this transition period to start during my pregnancy. He used to be a very well behaved child, maybe a little bit more emotionally aware than his peers. He is also the only grandchild in the family, the only child amongst our friend group as most of our friends are either single or without kids. So he is used to being the center of attention all the time. And he’s very much aware that this will be over once his brother is here.\n\nSo for the past few months, even though we spent all of the summer together (I don’t work and spent every hour of every day during the summer holidays with him), went on two big vacations as a family of 3, he seems to not get enough of me and gets really mad when my/or my husband’s attention is slightly on something else. I can play with him for hours and if I take a 5 minute break, he starts screaming, crying, yelling that I am a bad mom and he hates me. He doesn’t care when I get very tired from playing with him and tell him that I need to lie down for a couple of minutes. He doesn’t let me and my husband speak when he gets home from work. Even screen time doesn’t work as he wants our attention to be on whatever he’s watching and constantly asks us to watch with him.\n\nI have been taking him to play therapy weekly to help him better express his emotions, and his therapist also observes that he is very attached to me (in a healthy way she says) and very jealous of his unborn brother, even though we have been acting really cool about the whole pregnancy to avoid sibling jealousy. She has given me some tips on how to encourage a secure attachment and assured me that as long as we have established a secure attachment, we can set some boundaries with him but every boundary we have tried to set backfires on us. \n\nSo as I said, I am very scared of how things will go when the baby is here. I am sad that I spent all this pregnancy focusing on my son’s feelings and not prioritising my own needs at all. I am starting to feel doubtful about our decision to have another baby, which really makes me upset. \n\nA part of me hopes maybe him having all these big feelings in advance will help him better adjust once the baby is here? Is this a realistic expectation or is this period simply a trailer of how things will go once I give birth?\n\nI am open to any insights, suggesions or support from parents who have been through a similar change!\n\nTIA\n",

    "selftext": "We are members of our local YMCA and frequently use the facilities for a variety of things, but especially the indoor and outdoor pools. \n\nOur 4yr old is in the process of learning to swim. She has sensory difficulties and though we tried swim lessons they weren't particularly helpful and she wasn't able to finish the class because she became too overwhelmed/upset. \n\nEven before that I was taking her to the pool regularly and  working with her myself. We ustilize a kickboard, although sometimes the YMCA staff won't allow us to use the ones they have there. I got her a \"swim pack\" at the recommendation of the YMCA swim instructor, and it was incredibly helpful. It's been a year and a half and she can now swim independently with the swim pack on with 3 of the foam pieces. It's designed to make the child more bouyant, not to make them float like a life jacket. I am always with her in the pool. We can remove foam pieces as she gets stronger and eventually she won't need it. \n\nAll this past summer, about half of the time while at the outdoor pool, the lifeguards tell us she cannot use it as only uscg approved floatation devices are allowed. Which is incredibly frustrating, but it's the policy so fine. \n\nHere's my frustration; the policy is that children under 8 must use a uscg approved floatation device and be within arms reach of their parents. And that is not enforced at all. Children as young as or younger than my child run around the pool and you can't even tell who/where their parents are. Most wear puddle jumpers which are approved, but terrible for learning to swim. Some wear nothing at all. And the lifeguards don't say a thing. \n\nI don't mind following a policy if it's enforced equally. I think it's a dumb policy as it doesn't allow children to actually learn to swim except for in the swim classes that you have to pay for. As it stands it's almost impossible for me to teach my child to swim. With the policy not being enforced for the rest of the members I feel like it would be very reasonable for them to make an exception for us considering we are actively with our daughter and she is objectively safer than most of the kids in the pool with the approved floatation devices. \n\nI don't want to be difficult, but I don't know how to proceed. How am I supposed to teach my child to swim without access to a private pool? I there a way I can fight the policy?",

The only time we allow our kids (3 and 5) to wear lifejackets is if they’re on a boat or in the open ocean. They don’t even know what a puddle jumper is.

    "selftext": "I have three kids (8F, M5, and M3). My middle child’s behaviour dominates everything. The other two are normal good kids. But middle child’s is absolutely breaking us.\n\nHe’s fine when he’s getting everything he wants. But as soon as we say no, or try to discipline him all hell breaks loose. He starts with baby voices and whining. Then false apologising to try and manipulate us, then one minute later the screaming and shouting starts. We try to ignore it and focus on good behaviour but he escalates again - by screaming as loud as possible and whining repetitively to aggravate us. He gives no fucks where we are or who we are with. He will also get extremely violent especially with his little brother, pulling hair, slapping, raining punches, smashing things. \n\nHonestly, it’s getting to the point where I say to myself ‘I regret having this child / god I hate him’ and I physically want to harm him - especially when he lashes out at my youngest. At this point I’m raging and starting to find it harder and harder to control myself. To be clear, the way I think and feel when I’m like this is just internal. We don’t hit or get aggressive with our kids. \n\nWe’ve tried disciplining him by taking things away (tablet is max 30 mins a day and is often completely removed due to behaviour). We have a loving home with age appropriate activities for the kids. We’ve tried explaining why what he does is not the best way to deal with things. We’ve tried talking but we are met with nonchalance and silence. Occasionally he will say whatever he needs to say to get a treat or something we’ve taken away. \n\nThis is causing friction in my marriage as he plays us off against each other by being contrite and sweet to one of us and ignoring the other who he argued with. We then argue (never in front of the kids) over how to handle things. Dad tries to ignore the bad and reward the good, mum (me) wants accountability and changes. \n\nI’m not worried about who is right or wrong I’m just broken. Venting. Wondering how we can help his behaviour. We have no idea if this is normal at age 5?? He’s always been difficult since about the age of 2. \n\nI’m sad my other 2 kids often have to take a back seat due to his meltdowns. The youngest kid is also showing signs of copying these awful behaviours. \n\nAs for school, useless. No transparency and met with ‘no he’s fine’ when I bring his behaviour at home up to the teacher. I’ve applied for an autism assessment but it will take months/years and in the meantime I’ve got to find a strategy that works because we cannot cope with him. \n\nHas anyone experience with a child / dynamic like this? \n",

I was baffled by this and told her that I had never had a reason to reprimand her daughter at all, she’s always quiet and polite and cooperative. The mother was shocked.

    "selftext": "My son (2M), husband (29M), and I (30F) all went to his home country for a trip. I am the sole breadwinner and could only get two weeks off of work. But my husband and I decided it would be a good idea for he and my son to stay longer to visit with family, learn the language, and give my husband a bit of a break (he's a stay at home dad with no family support in our hometown). The two of them are staying for almost another month (4 weeks).\n\nI knew I was going to miss them, but I wanted my son to be connected to his culture and family. My mother in law used to take my husband back to their home country for a few months each summer while my father in law stayed behind in our current country to work and would only join them at the end for a few weeks, so it was packaged as a pretty normal thing. And it sounds like those trips were most of my husband's core childhood memories. I want my son to be able to have those memories too.\n\nBut I don't know how I'm going to keep doing this. It's been a week, and it hasn't gotten any easier. If anything, I miss them even more. I cry all the time, I'm barely sleeping, the place is a mess because I don't have the energy to do anything, and I'm generally miserable. The pregnancy hormones probably aren't helping either (currently second trimester). Our five year anniversary was this weekend, and whenever I think about it I cry. It was either be there for the anniversary or my son's second birthday with the way dates worked out, and I chose my son's birthday. We celebrated the anniversary early, so I thought I'd be fine, but I was very wrong.\n\nI'm really lost. We moved to our current city a little over a year ago, and I'm always at work or with my son, so I haven't made any friends here I can lean on. And I'm estranged from my parents. I don't ever remember feeling so alone. I know I signed up for this-my husband didn't push it or anything-and I know military parents have to be away from their kids for a lot longer, so I feel like a bit of a baby, but this is so so hard for me. And because I underestimated how hard it would be, I think that makes it even harder.\n\nMy son started out asking for me all the time, but now it seems like he's moved on. When I facetime now he says \"no mama, only nanna.\" He's growing and learning so much, which is amazing, but all I can think about is that it's all happening without me. He's going to come back a completely new kid, and he's not going to feel like he can trust me anymore since I left him.\n\nI've talked to my husband about some of this, but I don't want to worry him too much. There's not really anything he can do at this point. And he's already agreed we're never doing this again. But I still have three more weeks to survive of this. Someone please help me figure out how. I feel like an empty shell without my guys. Has anyone gone through something like this? What did you do?",

We try to help him with setting expectations. A smart friend recommended a transition chart for the morning so he got to check off each item on the list for a small prize. \n\nHe also abhors school, or at least that is what he tells us, everyday is “it was horrible, no good.” But he has a lot of friends and is very social. His teacher in SK flagged him as not following directions and not joining in age appropriate activities. The specialists and school therapist were brought in to observe him but he scored just high enough on tests to not get a school intervention (46) but that is definitely low for how intelligent we know he is from daily interactions. \n\nAfter a visit with his dr, referral to therapist and 5 months of therapy we decided to start him on a mild dose of Prozac. At one point I asked the therapist if he could have Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and she says she doesn’t like to classify kids this young, as much of their actions are age appropriate but her root belief from conversations with him is that he is feeling high anxiety. \n\nThe therapist has mentioned that for him a lot of decisions feel outside of his control so making sure he has options. We also had some success (in short not long-term) of making him a special quiet space at home with fidgets and stuffies and when he escalated we would say “you can choose to go to your quiet space right now and come out when you feel ready, otherwise you will be out in a timeout until we say you can come out.” \n\nI do feel like each year gets a little incrementally  better with him if that helps!",

Until I finally raise my voice and say something along the lines of OK. BATH TIME. NOW! and then he'll go \"ok ok\" as though meaning ok ok calm down woman (he obviously doesn't say that).\n\nI am tired or bribing and threatening, I am tired of feeling invisible, I am worried I am raising a rude and arrogant child and someone who doesn't respect others. I hate having to shout but if I don't he simply won't listen. \n\nThe worst part is when I have to do it at bedtime..

When you ask him calmly he still has some room to ignore you but knows that once the raised voice comes out you mean business. You need to always mean business. You can tell him in your nice voice \"The TV needs to turn off so you can have dinner. If the TV is too much of a distraction, then it means we need a break and won't be watching for the rest of the night.\" And then follow through. He still doesnt listen? Turn it off and put the remote up. Right now he thinks that until you yell you won't actually do anything about it. This is one example but I mean it with anything. You dont have to yell about consequences to enforce them. He gets one warning, he makes his choice, and you respond to that choice. It seems like it's a power struggle with you almost begging him to listen and negotiating and finally yell and put your foot down and so he is aware it doesnt matter if he listens until that point.

For kids who are already struggling to connect in person, having some safe online communities can be a lifeline, and if that outlet is cut off completely, he may just hide things from you in the future, which is far riskier. A healthier balance could be keeping an open dialogue, helping him join moderated servers, and setting boundaries together so he knows you care about his safety without feeling like he has no independence at all. That way he learns to navigate the online world responsibly, feels trusted, and still has the chance to build friendships in the places that matter to him.

My daughter suffers from high anxiety as well as poor focus. She got her license back in June and since then has totaled the car she got from her mom and been in two minor accidents with a car she was given by a friend.  I spent half the day today pulling dents and trying get the doors straight.  If you know anything about body work it's an ugly process and it usually looks worse before it gets better.  After grinding away some paint to weld onto the metal to straighter,  it's better but it's only step one.  Today when she went to take her car to work,  she asked if it would be fixed by tomorrow,  obviously not. Her next response was,  \"I have to drive my car like that to school?\". I was really taken aback by her attitude towards my hard work.  She goes to a school where money is plentiful and I certainly have the funds to buy her a new car,  but am I wrong for being so pissed by this attitude? I was raised blue collar by parents that worked hard for everything they wanted in life,  I am the same way.  I'm trying to teach her appreciation for things in life but she doesn't get it.  I hate her driving a beat up car but she did this to herself.  I know the comments she'll get from the other kids at school may be cruel and as her dad i don't want her to face that either.

My mum always told us about our money troubles, sometimes we’d come home and the tv in her room or the stereo would be gone, and she’d tell us she had to take it to cash converters for money to pay the rent. Things like that. Or “she spent her last $2 on a scratchie to try and win $50 to get us through”. So I have a lot of trauma around money. \n\nI do not want entitled kids. So I do share with them the cost of things. We don’t disclose what’s in our bank account. \n\nWe make sacrifices as a family. For example last year we had a nicer holiday that was more expensive than usual with my husbands family - when the kids wanted something or asked for a take away dinner or something - we would remind them that we are saving for our nice holiday so we aren’t going to get take away tonight. They actually responded so well to that, they absolutely got on board with sacrificing small things for a big reward. \n\nThey have birthday parties every second year. Next year our son needs a laptop for school, and that will be his main Christmas present because he knows a laptop is a big expense. \n\nThe kids are not stressed about money, they know we are comfortable but that we need to work hard for our money and it’s not endless. \n\nI think if you are transparent about sacrifices you make to save money or buy expensive things and your kids see that and also contribute to it, that guilt shouldn’t really manifest, because they also saw and lived the sacrifice for the reward.",

She’s asked questions like ‘how much does air conditioning cost?’ (Because we live in a desert and I’m always hollering at her little brother to not “let my cold air out”). \n\nWe’ve played some scenarios around some jobs she’s interested in. How long will schooling take, if any at all. And then how much would she make for a paycheck on average. We’ve then looked at apartments in the area and she’s set up a ‘budget’ with us as a general fun idea plus also a math lesson. \n\nHer mom and I are well off for our income and COL. we live modestly for the most part.

    "selftext": "UPDATE: First and foremost, thank you to everyone for the feedback. When I initially posted this I was incredibly anxious because it had just happened, but after I took a few breaths and read some of the comments (and spoke to my own dad lol) I relaxed a bit. Basically it played out exactly as everyone expected, she was super cool about it. \n\nWe went over and she showed us the damage, which was much smaller and easily reparable than what I’d imagined. My son took ownership of his mistake, apologized, and she joked about how he should be a baseball pitcher. She thinks she can repair it, declined his help, and said she doesn’t want any money. She thanked my son for being honest and told him that must have took a lot of courage, and she appreciates it. Turns out she used to be a therapist, which I imagine lends to her reaction to the situation, and worked specifically with boys my son’s age. We got to know each other and realized we have a lot in common, and she said she’s glad she got the chance to officially meet us. \n\nEverything is fine and I got to know a new neighbor. I’ve realized this also needs to be a learning lesson for me in not immediately assuming the worst. When we got home I thanked my son for being honest, gave him a hug, and told him I was proud of him.\n\n\n\nMy (32f) eleven year old son is a good kid. He doesn’t really get into trouble and tends to have a decent head on his shoulders. A few months ago we moved to a new town, and a lot of the folks in the neighborhood are older and more well off financially than we are. We’ve made friends with one of our neighbors who’s an older woman, and often greet other neighbors when passing by on walks or when headed out for work. It’s a quiet and safe neighborhood and we are really happy to be settling in here.\n \nFast forward to today, I hear my doorbell ring and see an older woman with a dog at my front door. I go out and she formally introduces herself, and mentions we’ve exchanged pleasantries before. She proceeds to show me a rock that apparently broke her mesh window screen and landed in her house. Her window was open so no broken glass (thank god) but obviously still concerning. I told her that I could look at my ring camera because at this point I didn’t even think this had to do with my kid, but she explained it came from the back end of the house. \n\nImmediately my heart sank, my son had briefly been out back and I knew this had to have been him. She told me that the screen needed to be replaced and because she’s a renter, she plans to let her landlord know to figure out how to go about replacing it. I told her I need to discuss with my son and, if it was him, then we absolutely would pay for the screen. She said she raised 3 kids of her own and clarified that she wasn’t accusing him, but it was heavily implied, which is totally fair. Somewhat condescendingly she said she planned to ask the elderly neighbor we’ve befriended if she did it, and I told her there’s no way (and no reason) she would have done that. She told me to come by later to look at it after I’ve had a chance to discuss it with my son, I gave her my number and we parted ways. \n\nMy partner brings my son to the living room and he admits he was throwing rocks, but that he was only throwing it at the tree in our backyard…sigh. We had a discussion about how he shouldn’t even be throwing rocks to begin with, which he already knows, how this could have played out much worse (the lady was in the room when it happened so it could have hit her) and he acknowledged that this was a really poor choice on his part. The plan is for all of us to go over so he can apologize to her and we can work out the details of paying for a new screen. He will be paying us back for whatever the cost of the screen is by doing work around the house, and he’s temporarily lost the privilege of being alone in the backyard. \n\nI’m really concerned that this is going to cause issues since we’re new to the neighborhood. I really love it here and don’t want to be thought of as a bad neighbor, I’m scared this is going to get back to our landlord and upset them. Like I said in the start of the post, we live in a town where most people are well off and we don’t fit into that category. I have pink hair and tattoos and I already worry that people here view me in a different light because of that. I do believe the incident was an accident, my kid has never maliciously caused harm, and I think this was a dumb kid thing that will be a huge learning lesson for him. I’m hoping someone here can reassure me that this isn’t the end of the world, I don’t want people thinking my son is a bad kid when he’s really not. \n\nI’m incredibly stressed out and just keep thinking how this is going to make us the neighborhood pariahs. Any advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. Aside from having him take accountability and apologize to her, and him paying to replace the screen, is there anything more I can do to reassure her that this isn’t a pattern of behavior for her to be concerned about?

    "selftext": "Would appreciate feedback, opinions, and advise as to how to navigate kids sports. To give some context, I have a 7 year old son, we live in a small rural’ish town (we are not originally from here), and my son shows interest in sports and has been in various sports since he was 3 (soccer, hockey, swimming, baseball). I am blown away with how quickly these leagues become competitive and have observed cliques being formed already where groups of parents like to hang out together and usually this is the groupings of these more competitive kids/parents. It seems like opportunities for these kids open up and others are being excluded - the most recent came up in baseball where a “select” boys team in this age range was put together by a couple dads and there was no try outs, it was just formed, while all the other kids of various skills were in the typical minor teams. It’s a small town so it created some waves. I am a bit older, not overly social nor is my husband, so honestly most the time we are oblivious or just don’t care. Well this past week it came to my attention that there was registration and tryouts occurring for a rep baseball team (2026 season but try outs in early September), and couldn’t find info anywhere (email, socials, website). When an email came out this morning that they reopened registration, stating it had been closed but they will reopen it, I responded to the president of the minor baseball Association with a very polite but direct email indicating that I wasn’t sure of the root of this problem, but it appeared that select families and kids were being notified of the tryouts while others weren’t being included. I stated in that email that if I overlooked information that that’s on me, but really was asking what the root of this issue was and expressing it didn’t land well as it appeared select kids/families were aware. He responded pretty harshly saying “you shouldn’t be thinking this way“ and reported that the main issue was technology related. I’m now sitting here, stirring, part of myself regrets sending that email as I’m an anxious person to begin with, while part of me is trying to reassure myself it’s okay to raise concerns, and that his reaction is likely not solely akin response to my question but I’m guessing other concerns that have been raised. Did I over-step? Maybe I just need thicker skin!? Ugh. I hate overthinking things.",

Save for the bathroom, there are no sectioned off rooms — just one living area.\n- he shares a room with his 1.5 year old sister\n\nThis to say, we can’t let him tantrum it out without waking up his sister and causing a nightmare for everyone. There’s nowhere to take him when he screams and cries because daddy needs to go to sleep before him, or he wants to fall asleep in our bed instead of his, or we try to take him back to his room in the middle of the night, or he’s woken up early and now he’s just marching all over the place talking loudly….\n\nWhat the hell can we do here. I just snapped and majorly lost my cool tonight and tried to wrestle him back into his bed. And of course he screamed and woke his sister. \n\nHe’s afraid of the dark and being alone, so my solutions so far are…\n- I let him turn all the hall lights on and keep his bedroom door open so it’s bright af\n- I remind him we are literally never more than like 20 feet from him at any given time.

She likes to say, \"Everything is my fault\" or \"You think I am the baddest kid ever\". All of this is kind of out of left field because we are careful about our words to her when she is being mean or hurtful to someone, we say something like, \"It's not kind to make fun of your brother. That hurts his feelings\". We are not accusatory or mean. We don't scream and yell. It just feels so weird to me. I know she is only 6, but she is extremely intelligent and honestly kind of scares me at times. I don't want to let this behavior continue because she will have a pretty hard time having friends and relationships if she acts like this.

It felt like the world was against me, i only wanted to be with the adults,  everyone my age was 'a young kid - we dont interact with those babies' and felt that i had to fight to stay alive. \n\nFor me, this came forth out of fear and not being understood. I lost my dad at an early age and later also more family members, i was horrified of getting close to people. I also felt left behind, as my siblings were smart, super social and knew what they wanted and who they were, i was none of that. While i did was chatty, i felt always confused, my dyslexia made that, where my siblings were just getting it, i didn't, and i just didn't have the words to say 'i need help' as i didn't knew how or what. This all resulted in me actually fighting other kids (just like the boys), shouting, manipulating other kids and even adults to get what i want, but also running away from stress and wanting to be an adult asap. \n\nFor me, my help came when two teachers noticed that i was depressed and sooo lost. They just talked to me and found words to the way i felt, for me to than use to ask for help from my family. I got into therapy, learned to find my voice and also got the chance to talk to my mom about this years later, finding out her side, which also really helped a lot. Years later, now, i still do feel the effects of this all, but i did found my way and feel comfortable again with whoem i am. \n\nMy tip, talk to her like she is an adult, but in kids language. So, when she hits someone, shouts, you just sit her down and talk, like adults, as this is the level she wants. Really get the feelings out there in words. But also, search for more help. Can be with school, can be a therapist, but some version of behavioural and talkative therapy should work to put words to feelings and how to deal with those feelings. \n\nAnd, might be a hard one, i also would include the whole family in this. Not as a 'becausd x needs us to do this', but for everyone to be able to get their feelings onto words. Because somewhere, somehow, she feels like she can't speak about herself, which often is a family issue. Can be because of siblings, can be because that is just what you both as parents grew up with or sometimes its as little as being younger and feeling behind. But whatever caused this, therapy can really help to figure this out, as well as guide you as parents to also get everything of your chest, as it is not easy being a parent, definitely when you are a parent to a kid who is closed off. \n\nGoodluck and big hug!",

The important message to them is that this is about ensuring your kids develop safely with limited mixed messages. \n\nSo, I’d start there with him, “assuming we both prioritize our kids safety, but we also want to balance that with age appropriate development milestones where they can begin to be on their own in safe situations, can you and I decide what those are based on a mutual understanding of what the risks of these situations are for them?  For example, if they were to get hurt, how do we imagine they would respond? Do we both need to be able to contact them in the event of an emergency? What if it’s my day to care for them, am I legally liable during that time? Yes? Then I must have all contact info. If their friend was hurt, would they know what to do? Do we want them to be in a situation like that unprepared?” And so on. The key is to not make it about you, but about the kids and your (probably) mutual desire to ensure that your kid doesn’t, say, burn down a house or get hit by a four wheeler or raid a liquor cabinet or something. \n\nObviously, I don’t know your co-parent, but trying to abstract it from “I’m the controlling asshole parent who says no to everything” into “I just care about our kid and if we just think about how we do this a little bit more generically, I’m sure we probably agree that some standard guardrails are useful for their safety and for our own accountability and duty to care for our children.”",

He has a skincare routine and has been wearing deodorant and body spray since he was 12 or 13 and noticed on his own that he was getting \"rank\" and oily a few hours after showering. He and I both stay on top of his laundry. He never re-wears clothes before washing them or even reuses towels/washclothes. I am fairly confident it's not him. \n\nI genuinely like all of these kids, and I don't want to single anyone out or embarass them. I also don't feel like it's my place to approach someone else's child about their BO. Nor do I want to pressure my son to do so on my behalf.

And I'm wondering how upfront/protective I should be of my 15 year old son. \n\nHis mom and I are not together. And conjointly we've lost multiple pets in the last month plus some other negative experiences. \n\nIt started about a month ago when his cat passed away (at his mom's house). \n\nThen a week ago, my dad had to be hospitalized. Thankfully he's been released now. \n\nLast week, on Thursday, his mom had a medical emergency where it seemed she was having a heart attack. He had to rush her to the hospital.   \nShe was released the next day, but she's in delicate condition and it was obviously a very scary experience for him. \n\nOn Saturday, my wife and I had a house fire and we lost our two cats. Which were as much his pets as ours. (He also lost everything that was in his room at my place.)   \nThat same night, his elderly dog ran away. \n\nOn Thursday, his mom went for a drive and found the elderly dog dead in a ditch. She has not told him yet.   \nFriday Morning, while my son was at school. His other dog got out of the gate and got hit by a car.   \nThis one will likely be extra hard as his previous dog also got hit by a car when he accidentally let it out.   \n\n\nHe's been staying at my grand dad's and sister since Friday. So he doesn't know the elderly dog was found or that his other dog was killed by a car. \n\nHis mom and I were talking about whether he should be told about the two of them. \n\nI think the uncertainty may be harder for him than the news. \n\nBut he's lost 5 pets in the last month, 4 of them in the last week. Plus the extra stress of his mom's heart condition.   \nI'm worried about all the pain this is causing him at once. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. \n\n  \n(For clarity, his mom and I don't live in the same country. He lives with her but comes and stays with me during his summer breaks and sometimes longer.)\n\nUpdate: just an update since I'm getting a lot of similar comments. \nHe started therapy this week to deal with it all. \nAlso it's good to see everyone agrees on telling him. It's what we planned to do, but it's good to get confirmation. ",

Almost all of her ships are not straight.\n\nHer mom is a very conservative Christian. I used to be until my own sexuality blossomed really late. Well, she has banned ships. No videos about them, no talking about them. She’s even banned certain friendships because those other children will talk about sexual orientation in a progressive way (she’s read texts and heard stories).\n\nI personally don’t care. She knows I’m not straight and so I’m trying to provide my own perspective and give her a safe place to explore her own burgeoning feelings (if there are any, that is).\n\nAm I doing wrong by essentially undermining her mom’s rules and wishes? What can I do differently if I should?\n\nPlease note when I say conservative Christian, I mean like if my daughter does turn out to be LGBT of any sort, she will be disowned.",

    "selftext": "I mean that literally - am I doing something wrong, or is my family's seemingly normal schedule actually not normal?\n\nI feel like there is no time to do anything fun with my children (2, 5, and 7) during the week.  The daily schedule on a typical day is essentially this:\n\n* \\~7am kids wake up \n* 7-7:30am - breakfast \n* 7:30-7:40 - clean them up, put on clothes, brush teeth\n* 7:45 - off to school (ideally; in practice it's usually more like a mad rush at like 7:55) - my wife typically takes them in the morning\n* 7:45-8am - breakfast (for me), then start working (I work from home; my wife is in the office a few days a week)\n* Mon/Wed/Fri:  the little one is in preschool and I pick him up at 3pm.  Our nanny picks up the other two at elementary school at 2:30 and I meet them at them at the park.\n* Tues/Thurs:  I pick up the older two and bring them to the park to meet our nanny.\n* \\~5pm - stop working, one of us (or both) get dinner ready\n* 5-5:30 - nanny arrives home with the kids - if it's on the earlier side, they want to play, but I can't because I'm making dinner\n* 5:30 or 5:45 - dinner \n* 6-something (6:30 on average?) - finish dinner, then I do the dishes and clean while my wife brings them upstairs for baths/brushing teeth/getting ready for bed\n* 7 or 7:15 - start putting kids to bed - generally one of us will take the little guy and the other will take the older two.  Read a couple books, maybe play a game with the older ones.  Sometimes a good chunk of this time is just trying to get them to put their pajamas on and/or clean their room.  Goal is to have them in bed by 7:30 (in reality this is usually more like 7:45), so there's about 15 minutes to do something \"fun.\"\n* By 8pm usually the two younger ones are asleep.  The oldest will then read in bed for another hour on average.\n\nSo basically our interaction with the kids on any weekday is:\n\n1. morning:  45 minutes doing whatever is possible to get them fed/clothed/cleaned and to school on time\n2. evening:  eating dinner together (5% talking, 95% cleaning spilled drinks/making alternate meals when they refuse to eat what we cooked/trying to get them to actually eat meal #2/etc.), then (for my wife) struggling to get them clean and ready for bed, then about 15 minutes of \"fun\".\n\nBasically we have about 3 hours together, and about 90% of that time is spent trying to get them to do things (all necessary) that they don't want to do.\n\nI feel like my entire relationship with my kids during the week is making them do stuff (and a lot of the time, getting frustrated when they don't do it).  I'd love to be able to sit down with them and play legos or a game or something, but there's just no time.\n\n  \nIs this normal?  Is my schedule not as normal as I think it is?  Do people actually enjoy trying to get 3 kids bathed/clothed/fed and consider that to be \"quality time\"?  Is there some obvious way to improve the above schedule that I'm not seeing?\n\nWhat am I doing wrong??\n\n",

In the end what happened that night was we made a game of guessing what jammies she wanted to wear while she was bathing with my mom purposefully choosing ridiculous things (like suggesting she wears her dad’s suit) and then when she seemed to be losing interest we chose the jammies she wanted and she got changed and went to bed.

They don't understand how bad their mouth can get and how gross it is. Just like how you sometimes have to forcibly change a baby who doesn't want to be changed. They're kids, not adults. There will always be some sort of lack of autonomy bc of their position as a kid (who is inherently pretty ignorant about the ways of the world and their own body, and half of kids would harm themselves without supervision).\n\nThere are toothbrushing toys and games out there but sometimes it makes it worse for neurotypical kids because they need to just get thru the task not elongate the task. Meanwhile kids with special needs who have mouth issues may need extra help and fun added to motivate them to brush.\n\nIf you really need to maybe change the toothbrush to a character or colored one, maybe use soft bristles or an electric toothbrush. It really depends on your child's specific needs. There could be so many reasons they don't want to brush their teeth. There are apps where kids need to brush their teeth for 1-2mins and it times them and there's a game involved. Again, this can really make scheduling worse if it gets out of hand but can use as potential sometimes reward for good consistent brushing???\n\nIf it came down to it, we brought the toothbrush to school, and did it in the guest bathroom or classroom if teacher allowed. Sometimes teacher would help the kid brush by saying\"ohhh we have to brush every day!\"and that pressure of two adults makes them kinda do it. Kids with oppositional defiant disorder or pathological demand avoidance are hard to deal with with these tasks so that's why sometimes a game or reward helps (but rewards given too often for too many things, make rewards unusable and loose their appeal, so they should technically be given rarely and kids have to work for it on a longer reward release schedule). Kinda how the real world works.\n\nSome kids with PDA and ODD, still couldn't complete the task with rewards and needed to be made to do the task :/ idk how that holds up psychologically, but it's true some kids have pretty bad temperaments and it has nothing to do with their feeding/sleeping schedule, but just them as a person, their parents/environment, or bc of a disorder. If that's a trait that will cause issues in the future, I'd seek help for dealing with the behavior and maybe a specialist could help with tooth brushing.\n\nEdit: didn't mean kiddos with dev dis are hard to deal with, just, that it is a bit more complicated than neurotypical kids. But also give kids a chance with the right environment to see whether or not it's a neurodivergent situation. Again, a specialist can help you so so so much!",

They push these boundaries to see if you will hold them firm or not.

Luckily my daughter upon impact had brought herself into the Fetal position in her car seat, id lent over and thrown my left arm over her to help pin her in (we were both properly secured in, mum brain just kicked in I guess) it was a right off, by whatever grace of the universe my daughter came away with minimum bruises and very minor scratches, no whiplash or anything.... I suffered quite severe bruising and whiplash but honestly im not even complaining. Extremely lucky, extremely thankful, for the impact it could have been a different story.\n\nMy issue:\nWhen we came to a stop I ofcourse shouted and asked if she was okay, she said yes, I said check your body are you okay? She said yes, I immediately called 999 and managed to get us both out of the car (with the help of a local pulling and holding the door), sat us both down on the side of the street while I gave the ambulance details (another woman came for my phone and took over) atleast 5 people at different points and sometimes more than once mentioned to my daughter and me how suprised they were she wasn't crying, how brave she was for not crying, how they would have cried and shes so brave...... I did have my little mentions to her that \"its okay if we need a cry aswell\" and all I got was \"no i dont need to im brave\" i didnt force it..... police and ambulance came..... mentioned how brave she was....... I knew this would come to bite me in the ass, to me I knew it was shock and she hadn't processed.\n\n\nAnd it has, it started with constantly telling people she was in an exciting crash and was brave and look at mummies poorlies (bruises etc) then added wanting to see the car pictures and the cctv of the crash, still checking my sores all while her hyperactivity has sky rocketed. My kid has always been a hyper kid, off the walls sort of kid, cannot keep still... but somewhat reasonable and manageable. I have lost all control.\n\nShe is so dysregulated, throwing herself from sofa to sofa isn't uncommon but the force shes doing it, constantly being told by everyone to slow down, calm down, take a breath. She use to spam talk calling me when she wanted my attention, we worked on the bluey hand hold and it got better.... now its like shes on speed, probably 7 consecutive \"mummys\" in 2.3 seconds, the minute she has any sort of telling off from someone, she takes herself away and exaggerated crys (she is crying but purposefully making it loud and forceful as opposed to her genuine crys) and if shes been told 2 or 3 times and theyve gotten serious (like her nan) shes then heartbroken, ive stopped her running off and started asking her for a hug so I can try and regulate her, im explaining and defending her to other adults but im honestly just waiting for the mother of all meltdowns.....\n\nI need to help her process this, I need a game plan on how I can help.. we're at the doctors Monday.\nIm working on the adults around her aswell... just cos the kid isn't knocked about like i am doesn't mean she wasn't in a damn car crash?!.\n\nAny and all advice honestly, please and thank you 🙏💗\n\nEdit: spelling",

I’m not sure if it helped but I read the books “I can say mama” and “I can say dada” to my baby and put together a my first photo album book with pictures of me, my husband, and my daughter so I can point us out to him. We do watch Mrs Rachel and I feel like that also helped. He can do the sign for more which I didn’t teach him, from watching her.

    "selftext": "My daughter is 5, and ever since she was a baby she’s never been into hugs or kisses. She would never kiss me goodbye unless I initiate it and honestly, she’s like that with everyone. The only time she’s really in my arms is at night when we sleep.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that at home she always wants to be near me. She follows me around constantly, won’t really play alone, and always asks for me. We do a lot together: we play, she takes my hand when we walk, and she’ll lie on me when she’s falling asleep. She also has good friends at childcare, she’s very talkative, funny, and otherwise thriving.\n\nPart of me wonders if I should be concerned about her not being physically affectionate in the usual way, or if it’s just her personality. At the same time, I can’t help but feel sad sometimes. I miss the cuddles and hugs I never really got, and it hits harder when I see other kids running into their parents’ arms or smothering them with kisses.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it something I should worry about, or is it just her way of showing love?",

In other words, this is not an anxiety you should allow to rule over you. The news media makes it seem like school shootings are much, much more common than they really are, and statistics are skewed that way too. (For example, one very prominent source that I won't call out here has in the past used a gang shooting that occurred on a school campus in the middle of the night as an example of a \"school shooting.\") Even data around general \"mass\" shootings can be extremely disingenuous.\n\nBut in reality, this is an astronomically low risk for your child - insanely, absurdly low. We should treat school shootings like we treat tornadoes or fires: something to be prepared for, but not something to be debilitatingly anxious about.\n\nIt's hard, I get it. I have a toddler and #2 on the way, and I spend a lot of time ruminating on the world I'm bringing them into, but this is something that, when looked at objectively, is not something that is rational to worry about as much as people do.\n\nAnd I want to be very clear: it's not that school shootings aren't a serious problem that need to be solved. They absolutely are. We shouldn't stop trying to fix the problems with our system until these events are a thing of the past entirely. But while that's true, it's *also* true that statistically speaking, your child is extremely safe at school, and I would try not to let this anxiety cloud your thinking.",

I am in an abusive relationship with my children that I not only have to tolerate but I also cannot retaliate. I do all of the things a parent is supposed to be doing: no spanking, time out appropriate to their ages, stick with routines, make sure to always check if they are hungry/tired/hot/overstimulated, use positive reinforcement, meaning when they do something good/kind, ALWAYS show them love and affection, being present (like not on my phone when they are around). I am not really looking for advice. I just want to hear from the parents that have been in my position that are now a few years down the line. Please does this behavior get better or did I bring two psychopaths into this world?",

I have to be stern, firm, and assertive with her at times. Sometimes I have to raise my voice a couple of octaves in order for her to know I am serious. It’s ok for our kids to see us “angry” or seeing what happens when they cross our boundaries. I am very intentional with what I do - alongside a lot of positive reinforcement and praise. Sometimes - if she is not listening, I have had to physically pick her up and move her - or physically stop her from doing what I asked her not to do. We are at a point now where (more often than not) I can give her firm warnings and she will stop the behavior because she can tell by my tone where things are going. Sometimes I can even say “mom is getting upset because you aren’t listening to me” \nand she will respond to that. \nShe hates time out, so she will usually listen to us before it gets to that point. But sometimes we do end up having to go there\n\nWe have never spanked her or anything physical. We don’t yell or scream or intimidate or swear or call names. \n\nNo matter what, after discipline and calming down, we always have apology sessions where we talk about what happened, how we all felt and what we need to do next time.

A little bit of back story, we just moved to SC from NM so a whole new school system. They were getting extra help a their last school(side classes) I’ve also learned that this is their teachers first year at this school. With that being said they have told me that the teacher yells quite a bit at the whole class he used to teacher 4th grade but now teachers 2nd. They say he talks too fast and moves through lessons quickly. He yells so loud that they want to cry. I know my child may be more sensitive than others but never have they ever said anything like this before. He’s not yelling at my child directly although I’m not sure. We were already looking into after school tutoring (we moved here just this month), i haven’t talked to the school yet but any advice on what questions to ask the school? I plan on going to next week. How disruptive would changing school be? Normally they don’t struggle with understanding math but the stress of what’s going on in class is making homework difficult. I knew they would need extra help coming to a new state but I didn’t think the teacher would be making that more challenging. I can get her after school help but if they don’t want to go to class something because of the teacher. Idk what to do. They say he’s not mean all the time they just feel like he’s treating them like 4th graders. Which I don’t understand how a someone can go into working with children and not work on having patience and understanding how to handle children. Would appreciate advice on what kinda help, helped other parents transition their child from another state school systems. I don’t want them to fall behind. I haven’t gotten any feedback yet, how long do I wait before going to the principal? I understand the teacher may be overwhelmed but what do I do if the teacher is unhelpful? Who do you go to test for learning disabilities? \n\nI have messaged (Wednesday, 3 days ago) the teacher but have yet to get a reply. This wasn’t the first message we moved in a few days before school started so we missed meeting the teacher before hand I emailed him to get anything we missed like school pick up info class schedule and expectations etc. I didn’t get any of that for a week. the first few days the school would not let me pick up my child from the pick up line without a car tag which they told me the teacher would give me one. he did not even after asking and yes I have his correct email. I had to go into the office to get it settled. When I did get the stuff I need especially the app the teacher uses to talk to parents. I’ve downloaded the app and sent one messages but have yet to receive a reply. ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nReposting because my original post was removed. We’re already under a doctor’s care and following their guidance, so I’m just looking for advice and support from parents who’ve been in similar situations.\n\nMy daughter is 8 and has been dealing with bowel accidents for a few years now. Some days are fine, but other days she can have multiple accidents, sometimes 3–5 in a day. These last few months have been especially tough, and with school starting, I’m trying to find the best way to support her so she can feel confident and less stressed. She is taking prescribed Miralax when it gets really bad. \n\nShe’s also okay with the idea of wearing protection, and she’s taken and used  her younger sister’s pull-ups a few times without asking. At school, I think pull-ups make sense cause i cant imagine the torment and anxiety if she has a leaky accident. They’re discreet and will help her focus on her day instead of worrying about an accident. But is it the right move? Is this a normal thing to do to your child with this issue? 😞\n\nAt home, though, I really don’t feel pull-ups are the answer. If she wears them, she may not seem motivated to try the toilet schedule. But maybe im wrong...\nBut Because of that, I’ve chosen not to allow pull-ups at home. Instead, and because of the sheer amount of accidents and grossness I’m leaning toward diapers when protection is needed. They’re much better for containing the mess, they keep her clothes from being ruined, and importantly; she provably wouldnt really want to wear them. That discomfort, I think, could help encourage her to keep trying with the toilet without making her feel shamed or punished.\nShe will always have the choice to wear underwear... I won't force her. But my laundry room floor is a mess with poopy underwear and it's getting worse.\n\nShe’s been in therapy for over a year, and I’ve worked hard on supporting her.. we’ve tried scheduled bathroom times, adjusted her dairy-free diet, added fiber, and kept her meals balanced. Despite all of that, the accidents are still happening. She often tells me she doesn’t even feel the urge until it’s too late, which makes me want to find a balance between keeping her comfortable and still encouraging progress.\n\nHas anyone else managed this balance; allowing pull-ups at school for confidence and discretion, but using diapers at home so that the situation is easier to manage and doesn’t reduce her motivation to use the potty? Did that approach help in the long run?\n\nThis is never about punishment. I love my daughter so much, and all I want is for her to feel safe and supported while we figure this out together.\n\nPlease Do NOT reply with medical advice or tell me to see a doctor. I am on it!! Please reply with your non medical recommendations and advice please so that this post isn't removed. \n\nI'm sure I'm not alone \nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Help! My 2 yr 3mo old toddler will go into a \"frenzy\" and start biting and hitting and scratching and basically all the bad things they shouldn't do. They think it's hilarious even during negative consequences. He does it sometimes during the day with no trigger but I would like to especially address the night time which is triggered merely by the arrival of bedtime. \n\n\nAt bedtime he gets so riled up. I keep thinking he's overtired but even when I try a super early bedtime it's like he knows oh it's bed time time to lose my f-ing mind. My daughter did the same thing at bedtime at that age so I'm wondering what is the deal with my parenting that my kids do this. I also thought maybe he needs more sensory input so I let him do summersaults and run around to try to \"get his energy out\" but that hasn't seemed to work so far? We have a calm down routine with a bath, books and calm music every night. Lots of attention and love and soft voices etc. But it's the dark room and the bed that unlocks the frenzy. \n\nDuring the \"frenzy\" once it starts there is nothing I can say or do that seems to work. Redirection (telling om that we kiss instead, or let's try gentle, let's play the hug game instead). I often end up walking out with very firm communication about hurting others and he screams and begs for me with what little words he knows while I hold the door closed. Like a reverse timeout but it feels awful like I'm teaching some abandonment or something. Like I won't come even if he's begging me?\n\nDuring the day we do a time out instantly for biting or hurting behavior. \n\nI don't have a place I can really leave him safely otherwise and honestly timeout is it's own struggle I feel like it destracts too much from the behavior and becomes it's own power struggle. \n\nWhat are parents doing? Am I the only one with kids that do this? I feel so lost with this. \n\n",

There is no “ask to change class” options. \n\nAlex has some struggles. They have ADHD (medicated), can talk a little too much, and has some sensory sensitivities. She’s a rule follower without always understanding that social rules aren’t the same as school rules. She’s made a couple of good friends and we have her working with an OT. \n\nLeah has some struggles. She is indulged at home and has unmedicated ADHD, so she’s impulsive, rude, and bossy. She sometimes physically manhandles kids when she wants them to do something with her, has meltdowns, and is rude to her teachers. \n\nThey can get along outside of school (both were on the same sport team) but in the class it is rough. Alex wants to be left alone or to be with her friends, and Leah wants to be friends. They’ve tried including Leah but she will try to boss the kids around at outside breaks. \n\nLast year we had to talk about how excluding Leah wasn’t kind but also that it’s okay to tell her she can’t be in charge. \n\nAlex had a hard time managing Leah’s behaviour. She knows she isn’t supposed to be rude but doesn’t want to be Leah’s friend. She’ll get paired with Leah because other kids are mean to Leah and she’s not. Leah is okay some days but other days tries to boss her around or says mean things. \n\nShe spends a lot of energy each day having to navigate being kind with not wanting to be around Leah. \n\nWe have spent SO MUCH TIME trying to help Alex continue to be kind but also hold boundaries. It was an almost every day discussion and makes school miserable. It’s exhausting and we were hoping for a break. \n\nUnless Leah moves this is a long term issue. \n\nWhat can we do to help Alex have positive days that aren’t focused on Leah? \n\nEdit: I’m appreciative of all of your advice. For those wondering how I know the circumstances of Leah, we live in a small area, they’ve played on the same sports team for a couple of years (again, no ability to change unless I keep my kid out of that sport) and I’m relatively friendly so I talk to their parents.

My daughter got her first phone when she had her 9 years birthday, a few months ago. \n\nOne of the rules we have with her and her big brother, is that YouTube time is limited and another rule is that we, the parents, get to see what they are doing on these phone. \n\nMy daughter has 30 minutes of YouTube daily, and one of the channels she watches have giving me concerns. I have tried telling her to stop watching that channel but she throws a big fit when I try. \n\nIt came to my attention when she laughed and told me that it was a mom and daughter, and the daughter was born in 2011 and the mom in 1997. That rubbed me the wrong way, and she proceeded to tell me that the father was in his 40’s. That’s when I bat an eye at her and trying to hide my absolute shock while trying to explain to her, that that’s not a good thing to watch. Furthermore, the content they make a sh!t. \n \nHow do I get her to stop watching this channel, and am I the only one seeing a problem here? \n\nDisclaimer: I live in a Scandinavian country, we have laws on forced marriages and it’s is a big no no in our society.

He complained at first but he got over it and now he barely watches YouTube. Your child can dislike a decision you make but ultimately you are the boss and you know better. It’s not up to her!

I have always felt we were on good terms, and usually when I’d invite them to hang out they would. A lot of the moms wouldn’t go out of their way to invite me or reach out to me, but I brushed it off as people being busy. \n\nThe majority of the people I invited to my toddler’s party were from this group and I received RSVP’s for 19 kids but only 3 showed up (the ones who came were family). About 45 mins in, I texted the parents who had RSVP’d yes to see if they were still coming and no one answered. I thought I must have messed up the invitation time or something. \n\nAfter the party I saw Instagram stories of some of the people I invited hanging out together so texted one of the moms and she was just like “oh sorry we ended up getting busy and forgetting to come.” I called her crying and asked if I did something to upset everyone, and she told me I did nothing wrong but she said something like “honestly I don’t think these girls will ever feel as close to you as you feel to them so I wouldn’t hold the expectation you’ll ever be close friends.” Which made zero sense to me. \n\nI’ve been so heartbroken. I know my son is still too young to feel rejection from something like this, but it breaks my heart to know that the “village” I thought I had actually doesn’t care about us. I personally cannot ever imagine just not showing up to something I RSVP’D yes for. Like they should have at least texted me to say they weren’t coming. I  made sure to buy enough food, party favors, cake, etc. It was also humiliating that I had to tell my family “I know all these people said they’d come but plot twist they’re all ghosting me.” \n\nI’m tempted to send a group text going off on the girls and never showing up to another mom group meet up again.

    "selftext": "Months ago I started trying to introduce the potty to my son who was 2.5 at the time , he showed little to no interest. I didn’t push it, would just ask if he wanted to use the potty if I noticed him pooping in his diaper. \nI have 3 different potties in the house, one with stairs to the toilet, one flat one that goes over the toilet, and one standalone potty that looks like a toilet. We decided to put it in the living room and it’s kind of just been sitting unused for weeks. This morning while I was getting ready for work , my toddler came to me, diaper off and I seen he had peed in the potty. I told him great job and said he can let me know next time he wants to use his potty. This evening I walked into the living room to him diaper off, and piling toys into his potty. I asked him why he’s putting toys in his potty and he said it’s a mess. Well he had peed& pooped in the potty and was trying to cover it up with his toys. Again I told him good job going on the potty and told him mommy or daddy will come help him after he uses the potty. \nConsidering tomorrow is a rainy Saturday and we’ll be home all day I’m wondering if I should start the morning off with trying underwear and seeing how it goes? I don’t want to put too much pressure on him and make him step back from it \nAny tips + advice appreciated ",

I am prepared for defiance, and I know how to stand strong with important boundaries. I know how to deal with my son when he backtalks me, but I don’t know how to react when he yells and sasses my sister who lives with us. It hurts because she loves him so much and is just trying to be helpful when he is being difficult but he rages at her. Any advice about how to respond to him yelling at her would be so helpful.\n\nThe other side of the coin is he switches like a lightbulb and is suddenly SO compliant with me. He desperately wants my attention and affection, baby talks, brings me things from all over the house as “presents,” wants to literally stand on my feet and hug my legs. This happens especially when I am trying to get certain tasks done like make his food, clean up, put his laundry away. Everything he does is “mama look,” EVERYTHING. And he even cleans up after himself, shows me how he is trying not to make a mess, and apologizes about 100 times a day. THIS I am not prepared for. Yes I have asked him things over the years like not to make a mess or clean up sometimes or apologize when someone is hurt but my big worry is I have somehow guilted him into feeling small. He is very sensitive to criticism and gets very sad if I ever scold him (rare because asking is usually enough).\n\nI just love my little guy and want him to know it.

If the baby fusses, he swoops in and takes him. If we’re playing on the floor, he’ll pick him up.

When I finally have those precious hours, my FIL is right there, monopolizing him. Sometimes I feel like I’m competing with my own FIL for time with my child.\n\nHe also makes comments that really undermine me. For example, my son was in his high chair the other day, just moving around a bit (I was sitting right next to him the entire time), and my FIL said, “Give him to me otherwise he will fall off the chair.” Like… what? He was completely safe, strapped in, and I was literally right there. It made me feel like he doesn’t trust me to even watch my own baby.\n\nIt’s starting to feel really overbearing and a little disrespectful of my role as his mum.

How did you set boundaries without it blowing up?\n\nEdit: I spoke to my husband in a very non confronting way. He tried to explain that he’s feeling attached because my FIL is going through something (which I’m aware of) and our son is basically his ‘emotional support’ which made me uncomfortable and frankly angry. I explained to him that he just turned one and he’s already someone’s emotional support? That’s not his responsibility. He’s just a baby. ",

Sometimes kids are sick, and the thing that will heal them is time - we're talking an average, every day cold, not pneumonia. \n\n\\- our kids fuss ALL THE TIME at their house, because they know the second they whinge they'll get what they want. We've had situations where before the kids even know what's for dinner they've whinged that they don't want it, and Grandad's there making sandwiches because \"oh, they said they didn't want to eat what we're eating.\"\n\nThe management over the top of my parenting is constant and beyond frustrating, it drives me absolutely bananas, but I also think it's part of his personality and I don't think I can change how he is, so the answer here is to spend less time with them. Set boundaries around when they can visit, and ideally, it should be your husband setting these boundaries because it's his family. Just because they *want* to visit every day doesn't mean they *should!* You need time and space to yourself and to develop a bond with your baby - don't feel guilty for this.

Her response was “yeah I just can’t remember what she said”. Mumma knew. I said ok, let me talk to your teacher because the plan isn’t working. She finally admitted she never asked the teacher… I don’t accept lying. It’s a big deal for me. The teacher is being amazing helping her with this and her efforts shouldn’t be wasted. The point is to learn this stuff. We don’t lie, and we’re not lazy and we ask for help from the people we trust when we need it. \n\nCue Punishment. I’m don’t want to take things away anymore. I want to bolster with action so I decided some community service was in order. Then I thought… I’m going to get her to pick up dog poop. We live in an area where people don’t always pick up after their dogs. Too posh to pick up. I don’t care how long it takes, she needs to collect 10 stranger dog poops and dispose of them to save her neighbours shoes and cars. Is that wrong? We have a dog we walk ourselves and we pick up its poop always and tbh we collect random poops too, just a general kindness. But this makes it something she has to do… Is making my daughter do this, wrong? ",

There isn’t really a real-world scenario where lying to someone ends in picking up dog poop. I think this punishment will cause resentment towards you to be honest and I think it will just make her get better at lying.\n\nI think it would be better to sit and talk to her… why did she lie in the first place? Did she feel uncomfortable or embarrassed asking the teacher? Did she just forget? I think it’s also important to recognise whether the lying is sporadic or whether it’s becoming a pattern. Just from this example it doesn’t feel devious! \n\nYou need to make it clear that the behaviour you didn’t like was the lying to you, rather than just not asking the teacher but it does seem like there will be a reason for it! 12 is hard especially if you feel like you can’t be totally honest with your parent and it’s only getting worse.\n\nMy parents raised me to be totally honest even if I did wrong and everything will get sorted as long as I tell the truth. At 15 I told my mum I was in a sexual relationship and wanted to go on the pill and she took me to the doctors straight away, no judgement and made sure I had condoms and was being safe. \n\nI also went to parties and tried drugs/alcohol, my parents weren’t happy about it but they created a safe space where I could be honest and I knew I could call them if I didn’t feel safe (which did happen!) and I was honest with where I was which my none of my friends were, they just got really good at lying. That only happened because my parents encouraged honesty and a safe space. I quickly came out of those risky behaviours using my own decision making, unlike a lot of my friends. I still have an excellent relationship with my parents. \n\nI know they’re extreme examples but the point is if you punish this behaviour with something gross, embarrassing and unrelated without actually talking to her, you’re only pushing her away which will lead to more lying, less trust and a worse relationship in the long-term.",

We've always shared a special bond, at least I thought so. We spend time together weekly, having fun in the community and discussing life. They use they/them pronouns, and I've always respected that. I thought I was doing a good job being present, supportive, and engaged.\n\nLately, though, everything's changed. Wren has been pulling away. They don't want to see me as often, barely respond to messages, and recently sent me a very intense message saying they're afraid of how I react during serious conversations. They said they avoid talking to me to \"keep the peace.\" That I don't take accountability and always blame others. They said I was lucky they were even bothering to talk to me.\n\nIt was hard to hear.\n\nWhat hurts most is that I didn't see it coming. I've been trying so hard to be a good parent. I know I am neurodivergent, which means I often miss emotional cues. I never meant to make them feel unsafe or unheard, but clearly, I have.\n\nMaking it harder is the influence of their stepmother. She's very controlling and seems to be pulling more of the strings in their household. My ex-husband doesn't intervene. I'm trying not to blame anyone, but it's hard not to feel like Wren's slipping further away because of that environment.\n\nI've sent them a card with a message acknowledging what they said and explaining myself without making excuses. I included a blank piece of paper and an envelope, just in case they wanted to write back. I'm trying not to push, trying to be patient. Still, I'm also heartbroken and feel like I'm grieving a relationship that might not come back.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? I know 16-year-olds often pull away from their parents, but it seemed so sudden to me. They say it’s been bad for a while, but that wasn’t my impression.\n\nI will say this kid does tend to be overdramatic and is often bullied at school because of it. I’m sure that tendency is playing into this. I still don’t know what to do, but wait, and that sucks. I have my own sensitivity, which makes waiting without any due date so difficult.",

    "selftext": "My son will be 10 this year and I was planning to give him one of those retro video game things (switch knock off) but one thing led to another and I found myself booking a cruise using the funds we usually use for going back home for a month. I decided on a whim that we would travel to a near by country to do a short cruise trip there. He is CRAZY about cruises and in his rare times he is allowed to watch youtube he wants to watch about cruise ships. Not the crazy big ones with amusement parks regular ol ships excites him too. So I booked it and fully paid. There will be a few days in the city we will be doing the cruise from so I also plan to take him to the water park which claims to be the biggest in the south half of the world. It has attractions I know he would want to try.\n\nSo now I don't know if I should be giving him the video game thing along with the cruise gift? Cruise is a huge out of comfort zone for me, to travel, to carry all the mental load etc as an autistic single mom is so hard on my nerves so i am doing this for him. I was thinking I can design his birthday like a treasure hunt theme where at the end his gift will be tickets? And game boy thing could be for his next birthday? \n\nI kinda don't want to do both at the same time because I am afraid he will be glued to the screen during the cruise. But also the airline we will be flying has no entertainment system and he flies easy only because of the planes we used to take had them. So I can totally get the help of the screen.What would you do?",

    "selftext": "As a child, my childhood was not good. I don't like talking about it. Teenage years were not better. Anywho, I have a husband and a daughter who is 8. I try to be a good mom, but I feel like a failure and like a failed her. When she was young(5ish?), her father almost died because of liver failure, and he had to stay in the hospital for like a month and a half. I went with him, and she stayed with 2 sets of grandparents that whole time. They are not great role models in different ways, but it was all the support I had at the time. During this time, I feel like I failed her because I went with him. She was so sweet and nice. Since then, we have lived with husband's mom and husband. They are good to us. We've been here for around 3 years-ish. I feel as she's gotten older she's hateful toward me and has an attitude every time she talks to me. Idk... I know I'm not the best( I have anger problems, mental problems,  severe anxiety and stress, shitty job, etc). I just feel like crying all the time now. I can't talk to anyone because I have no friends, can't talk to husband because he doesn't understand,  can't talk to mother-in-law because she'll say turn to god and that's a no for me. They used to play argue, and we've gotten them to stop because she starts arguments all the fricking time since that happened. Idk what to do. It's either she gets what she wants or she pouts, turns hateful toward me when I say no, and she gets pissy because she doesn't get her way. She acts like I beat her when I raise my voice( I try not to, but she pushes me to my f*ING limit). I don't like yelling at her, I try not to. I don't like telling her 20 times to clean her room, and she acts like she's 2. I don't want to talk to a therapist because I have trouble talking about my feelings, emotions,etc. I try to get her to talk about how she's feeling thinking that would help with outbursts, but she refuses to talk to me or how she feels. I don't know what to do anymore. She's fine when dad is around, normal girl occasional attitude but nothing overwhelming,  only when it's just us. I don't smack her, I don't bust her, but I can't ground her because that does nothing. the corner does nothing. Idk what to do. We were trying to get our own place, and we try not to talk finances around her, but she always talks about us being poor, etc.  There are just so many things in my head. It doesn't matter if anyone responds to this. I just feel like giving up and wanted to vent to something. ",

    "title": "How should I handle rudeness and cruelty from my middle schooler?",
    "selftext": "Vulnerable post today. I have four kids and I feel like I have always been close to them, but within the last year my daughter who is very nearly 13 has become extremely rude and even cruel at times. I get that she's going through puberty and middle school is hard, so I expect it to some degree, but it's been getting to a point where I'm wondering WTF I have done wrong raising her because she is so damn mean. I don't know how much I should let slide because of her age and and how much I should punish her for. I also don't know the best way to punish her, because I'm a big fan of natural consequences but I'm not sure what a natural consequences of her making nasty comments to me could possibly be. \n\nI hit my breaking point this week when I was driving her to her sport, and she commented about how all her friends are surprised that she has such a young mom (it's true, she was born when I was 20). Then she went on to say, very viciously, that it sucks for her that I'm young because then she'll have to have me around longer. It felt like a goddamn knife in my heart because my own mom died when I was 18 and I have spent every day of my life since missing her. \n\nFrom the day my daughter was born I have vowed to be the best mom I can be for her. I have always been terrified of dying young like my mom did and leaving my kids without a mother. To hear my own child say that they would like me to die sooner hurt so much. My own mother's death and everything I went through after was so traumatic that I still cannot talk about it. \n\nThe only thing I could even bring myself to say at the time was, \"well, luckily for you longevity doesn't run in the family so maybe you won't have me around too long.\" I then dropped her off and sobbed in my car. This was last week and it's been bringing me to tears nearly every day. I feel like I need to address it with her, but like I said, I literally cannot talk about my mom's death. \n\nI have been doing a lot of reflecting and wondering why she apparently hates me so much, and I don't know what I could have done to provoke so much animosity. I bend over backwards for her and her interests. I have supported her in her music, her (extremely expensive!!!) competitive sport, and make sure to have lots of one on one time with her. I try to talk about her feelings and always tell her how much I love her. I sacrifice so much so she can have a better life than I did. I go without a lot so that we can afford the things that are important to her, but it seems like it is never enough for her. \n\nI have friends with kids her age whose children still hug them and tell them they love them, and it breaks my heart that my own daughter pushes me away when I try to hug her and makes it clear that she does not love or respect me. She has said so many hurtful things and I tell her she needs to be respectful but it never seems to make a difference. Even her own friend called her out recently and I overheard her asking my daughter why she's so mean to her mom and telling her she should be nicer. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do about my daughter's cruelty? Other than that, she is amazing. She's extremely smart and gets straight As in an advanced program at school. She plays two instruments very well. She's heavily involved in a competitive sport. She seems very kind and empathetic to other kids (so why so cruel to me and her younger brothers?) \n\nI'm starting to feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with her. I spend so much time trying to have a positive relationship with her. I take her out for her favorite treat just the two of us so we can talk. I make sure she gets plenty of time with her friends. I spend SO MUCH time and money on her music and sport. I'm talking hours and hours every week and about $600/mo plus other expenses for her music and competitive sport. We are financially stable, but we are definitely not wealthy, and this is a LOT of money to us. I have literally put off receiving medical care for myself because I know how important it is to her and I want to support her. Despite all that, she is constantly being cruel to me and her siblings too (today she was belittling her brother for not being as good at piano as she is). \n\nHow am I supposed to handle this? I'm lost and extremely hurt. ",

No one said anything to my wife and upon her return home, she sent an email to the teacher inquiring about our daughter's story. The email below is from her teacher.\n\n\"Thank you for reaching out about this. This is exactly what happened. It was a misunderstanding, and I felt terrible that this happened to (daughter). We've been working on lining up quietly especially because we are next to a 3rd grade class that is still learning while we are lining up. I don't want there to be disruptions to their classroom. So, when students are talking, I ask them to \"try again\" they are supposed to just walk back to their desk then come straight back out to the line. I've been doing this since last week so I mistakenly thought my students understood that they were to come right back to the line. We walked to lunch and (daughter) was still in the class. Another teacher saw her a few minutes later and walked her over to the lunch tables. Principal spoke with (daugther) about this and made sure she was okay. I also went out and found her on the playground to talk to her, to see if she was okay, and to apologize about the misunderstanding. I gave her a big hug and explained to her that this was a mistake on my part and I was deeply sorry she was scared. I felt terrible! I also want her to feel safe at school. I would never want my students to feel scared. I will continue to communicate with (daughter) and make sure she feels safe at school, in the classroom, and with me as her teacher. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out again.\"\n\nEnd email:\n\nWhile, we appreciated the email back, we still feel bothered that not only was our 6 year was left unattended but there was a huge lack of communication to us about the instance until we reached out.\n\nI am looking for advice on how to handle this situation. We obviously will speak with the principal but would welcome any other thoughts or suggestions. We definitely do not want our daughter to feel like she did anything wrong and don't want her to be afraid of being punished like this in the future.\n\n  \nUPDATE:  \nThank you all for your replies.

Two other girls became her close friends, they have sleepovers etc. we roomed together at a dance convention, and I feel semi close to their moms, we talk on the phone laugh etc. one mom is very gossipy and it’s become very apparent lately, so the other mom and I don’t like gossip and are just trying to be kind as our girls are close. Our three girls have iPads and I would let my daughter FaceTime them for about an hour or so during the day in the summer. I am very good about monitoring what goes on with her iPad, and she has a ton of parental controls. Today at dance though I was sitting outside with the two girls moms and another mom who we like but her daughter doesn’t hang with our girls. The mom we don’t hang with I will call Ashley, said to the gossipy mom who I will call Angela “did you ever tell her (meaning me) about the phone calls”. Angela said what phone calls? Ashley said the ones over the summer? Angela responds with “oh yeah, when the girls would talk on the phone your daughter (she used her name) wouldn’t hang up the group calls the right way. So everytime my daughter would call it would just auto connect, and she told me and so we would sit and listen to what was going on at your house.” They did this several times, I have no idea how long or how many times, and no one ever said a word to me. I literally had no idea group calls stayed open if someone didn’t hang up. The iPad is effectively taken away, but I feel like this is insanely creepy for an adult to do. What do I do? I feel uncomfortable. I was so mad and all I could think to do was laugh and say if you are a fan just say that. But I’m really freaked out. ",

My parents were right to recognize that and let me choose something else, but I wish they'd given me a little more guidance in picking something \"normal\" - I was an oblivious kid who didn't realize that I'd picked a weird name and then it was really awkward trying to get out of that.  \n\nOverall my parents do have a tendency to grab onto something someone likes and then do it forever - like if you say you like pigs you will get only pig-related gifts forever.  So my advice is, don't shoot it down, but don't go all-in right away either.  Take the whole thing with a grain of salt and not too seriously.  Call the kid that name at home.

I knew when people talked about how the threes were when the trouble really started that this was coming, but wow it’s hard. \nEvery single time he doesn’t get his way it’s screaming and throwing himself on the floor. \nI’m a gentle person, I grew up in a very angry household with constant screaming and blaming. I do not want that for my son. I’m not trying to put him in fight or flight and wreck his nervous system. \n\nHowever, how the hell do you punish your child. Today he was particularly bold. I know it’s tiredness. His naps are now over with his preschool - although I’m trying to insist they let him nap still - he’s a lovely child. Sweet personality and really gentle - but nothing works. He tells me why he’s in trouble “I hit mama” but nothing changes. He doesn’t listen, I try to be gentle and say he has 2 minutes then he has to listen but it leads to a tantrum. \n\nWhat has been the most effective way of teaching your child manners.\n\nHe is not allowed screen time anyway so I can’t even take anything off him. I try natural consequences but mostly these instances occur out in public where I just have to pick him up and carry him off because there’s no other option. \n\nAt home I can take a toy off him but I don’t want to threaten to send him to bed because he’s an amazing sleeper so I don’t want bed to be a punishment. \n\nAny tips are greatly welcome because I am tired and I want to go back to enjoying our time together.

After 5 stickers we allowed tv (because we are okay with it for now as we are adjusting with newborn) and after 10 would get an ice cream or something else.  They were very motivated by getting stickers and the warning of loosing a sticker worked really well.  There were less meltdowns from all of us and really trying to recognize all the good listening and helping and positive as much as possible.  I don't know if its correct parenting, but it was a game changer for us.\n\nEdit:  just to add, also instead of timeout, we do a calm down time, where they go to the stairs and count to ten with their fingers breathing in big and when they are calmer we try again.  This also works better than a time out for us.  They have to then say their sorry If they hurt someone and we talk about what happened briefly.",

Sometimes it can be a 30secs to a few minutes and sometimes it’s 10-15 mins. He refuses almost everything like leaving the park, bath time, trying to get him in the high chair or car seat. He’s always been difficult like that even as a baby but I just don’t know if this is normal toddler behavior or not. I know there’s the terrible twos and I think he is teething so maybe that’s making them worse. I just want to know peoples experiences at this age.

However, here are some things I have learned so far.\n\n\nMy 1.5 year old is much more cooperative and accepts transitions much better when I give her some time to adjust and let her finish whatever she is doing before directing her to another activity. In practice that means I always come to her a few minutes before I want her to do something. I talk to her about what we'll be doing next while I let her continue doing whatever she's doing or I play with her for another minute or two. Only after that I direct her to the new activity. \n\n\nIt is the same when we're on the playground - there is a transition period there, too. We pick up our toys, return the toys that belong to other kids (if the kids shared them), say goodbye to the kids and their parents, pack the rest of our stuff, I give her something to drink, etc. It is a process.\n\n\nI really try my best to never have an (over)tired or very hungry toddler on my hands, because that is just a recipe for disaster. That sort of situation would be all about my daughter acting up because her basic needs aren't met and would hvd nothing to do with anything else. If I suspect she's getting in a weird mood, because she's hungry, I give her a piece of bread or something else to chew on, before I even attempt doing anything else. It usually works. \n\n\nI am also mindful of the body language and the tone of voice I use when talking to my kid. Kids are very perceptive and sensitive to those things. If I see she's getting unhappy about the change in activity, I try to be positive, relaxed, playful and upbeat in my communication style and try to redirect her thoughts to something else, perhaps make some funny faces and funny noises or I give her a choice of a toy to take with us to the kitchen when it is time for dinner, etc.\n\n\nWhenever I tell her \"no\", I make sure to explain to her why exactly she is not allowed to do something and offer her an alternative that she is allowed to do. That seems to help, too. However, when it doesn't help, I juat accept that she's going to have a tantrum. I don't budge, because I don't say no without a good reason, so a no stays a no and she just has to deal with it.\n\nThere are always situations where we need to do something she's not on board with, though, for example washing her hair. I do my best to make the experience as comfortable as possible for her but that is as much as I can do. I wash her hair, she screams, I ignore her or sometimes count down the time until I am finished. When we're done and she's calmed down a bit I try to get her in a better mood, do something fun with her, compliment her on her beautiful hair (which she likes) etc. It is a bit like making up with someone after a disagreement.\n\n\nThat is as much as I have learned so far. I hope other more experienced parents give you more useful tips.\n\n\nGood luck!",

Because she will be starting first grade next week and will be using her daycares before and afterschool program we will no longer qualify for subsidy which means our daycare bill is going from $326 per month to $800 per month with less hours even being at the daycare.  We have made the extremely difficult decision to put her in daycare only 2 days per week and my husband will alter his work schedule on the other days in order to take her to school and pick her up.   I told her about this plan last night and she was really upset, she said she wanted to stay in daycare and didn't want her dad to pick her up.  I'm feeling badly because at daycare she gets to play with her friends but at home she will likely just watch her iPad or watch TV.  I spoke with my husband about putting her in Monday, Wednesday and Friday as Friday they only go to school half day but he got annoyed and said there was no way he was going to pay for a day of daycare when he can pick her up from school.  Anybody else in the same boat.  I'm honestly just looking for reassurance that everything will be okay and that my daughter will still have friends and still be happy,  I just hate taking something away from her that she absolutely loves.    My husband thinks once school starts she will appreciate him picking her up and being able to go home 3 days per week and that she's just sad because daycare during the summer holidays is fun, they do fun things like go to the park, go for slushies, take field trips etc., I hope he's right...",

    "selftext": "I have three adult children in their 20s. I raised them on my own, with the youngest being 3 and the oldest 7, when they saw their dad for the last time. Their dad was a coke and heroin addict, and it took me a few years to leave—everything you’d imagine came with it, from financial ruin to domestic violence. The moment my ex turned on the children, I left.\n\nAnyway, I had no family to turn to, nothing. We were homeless at times, we moved a lot, even countries, and even stayed on trails in tents, trying to hide, because my ex was trying to find and hurt us. But over time, though, we started healing. I went to therapy, focused on raising the kids, trying to make a living, and keeping us at least somewhat afloat. We all worked hard. My kids worked for a few dollars anywhere they could so we could buy food or pay the electricity bill. Meanwhile, they went to school and studied. I went to every school event I possibly could, cheered them on in any way I could, and tried to find solutions for anything they wanted to do that we couldn’t afford or didn’t have the means for. Above all, my routine with them stayed consistent; for example, every evening after homework, we ate dinner together, and I read them a bedtime story when they were little, or we went to the local libraries every Saturday, stuff like that, no matter where we were and how bad it was. \n\nFast forward to today: I just hung up the phone with my oldest. He works in a job he loves and moved in with a sweet girlfriend who cooks for him daily—his biggest worry right now is the resulting weight gain. My other son just finished his master’s and is job hunting in a new city with his girlfriend, calling me for advice on job interviews and fashion choices. And my daughter—she’s finishing her doctorate, takes care of four pets, visits me daily because she lives close by, and is basically like my best friend.\n\nThe reason I’m writing all this is not just because I’m obviously immensely proud. No, it’s because I realized that all my children are kind, caring, educated, hardworking adults. I was so scared when they were growing up, because I had nothing, at times not even running water or a roof over our heads. But I marched on. I made sure they knew how to be consistent, ambitious, and hardworking. It wasn’t that I sent them to special schools, or that they had some incredible coach or life-changing experience. No, they were just kids who knew what my expectations were, and they also knew I was proud of them, supported them, and would go through fire for them if needed. Somehow, that seemed to be the most important thing.\n\nI’m not saying that providing all the other things parents (myself included) worry about aren’t important. But I want every worried parent out there to know: you don’t need to be perfect—you just need to *be there*. At times, all I had to give was simply *being there*. But that seems to have been enough to raise adults with both drive and empathy.\n\nWishing you all a good night, y'all are doing great <3",

Pretty much since my son started eating regular food, people in the family (and pretty much exclusively men - his dad and both male grandparents) will just help themselves to the food on his plate, regardless of if he's finished or not. My son is now 4 and has gotten very upset about this at times, he's even cried about it in the past when someone has finished his food that he still wanted. He recently announced \"New family rule! No one is allowed to eat food off my plate\". I backed him 100% as this really bugs me.\n\nLast night we were out for an early dinner for my partner's birthday with his parents. I ordered my son's meal first so it arrived first, and there were fries on the side of his plate. Pretty much the second it gets put down, his grandad (my FIL) started helping himself to the fries. He didn't ask, he just started eating. I noticed my son was quiet, so even though it was awkward, I mentioned to the table, hey, we have a new family rule that no one can eat food from my son's plate unless he says it's ok. Then grandad proceeds to start tricking my son by getting him to turn around and distracting him so he can keep eating his fries. My partner was also eating them. By the time everyone else's food arrived, my kid was left with barely any fries on his plate. It's my in-laws so I didn't say anything further about it, but I don't understand why it was so hard to just not eat the child's food. \n\nIs this normal?!?!? Or just something in my family? I would not enjoy it if my plate were treated like a family share plate with people sticking their hands in and helping themselves - surely a child should be afforded the same respect?

I came with children, (now aged 11m and 13f) and immediately they hit it off with my girlfriend/fiancé/wife. I used to joke that of my kids two parents, their favorite one was my girlfriend. Cuddles watching movies, lil’ shopping trips, you name it. I am a 3 day a week parent, and the rest of the week they’re with their mother. \n\nA little backstory, I am 4+ years sober and my wife has been sober since about two months before we met. My ex was (I think still is, no proof though) a very big drinker and almost lost custody to me last year. I used to be regaled of stories of her terrible boyfriend and her drinking every weekend.\n\nA couple months ago, my daughter was in a depressive state and my wife sat her down and had a heart to heart. Something along the lines of “you’re not helping yourself doing nothing in your room, being lazy and unmotivated” and that completely put my daughter off of her completely. No more shopping trips or hair dying or anything. Basically no contact. I get what my wife was trying to say, and feel like she gave some hard advice that was not received well. \n\nSimilarly, my son was being “playful sassy” (his words) and backed talked my wife along the lines of “your grounded missy, go to your room” and the way he said it was not playful nor was it taken as such. My wife responded saying not to speak to her that way, which again, I completely understand. Now he has given her the cold shoulder. \n\nBoth kids basically refuse any contact with her and refuse to come to my house. I’m at my wits end trying to reunify my house and I feel like I’m fucked no matter what I do. Any advice would be completely welcomed \n\n\n\n",

I mean, this is a 13 yo girl with a tough childhood, not a peer in rehab. \n\nShe was the fun adult, not a parent. It would be hard enough to to bridge from that into parenting anyway, especially as they had two parents already and still living. \n\nShe may also have been a safe space for both kids, given that the mother drinks a lot and you used to drink a lot. I mean, your ex almost lost custody. She doesn’t have the baggage that you and your ex have, and she was kind and fun and understanding.\n\nAnd then she, a trusted adult, kicked your daughter in the gut when she was at her lowest. The things that you refer to her talking about are classic symptoms of depression, not personal failings.  And you can’t really treat depression by pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, especially given all the turmoil she’s had in her life on top of being a 13yo girl. It depends on the cause of the depressive episode and how bad it is. I mean, these sudden changes in behavior can flag some serious shit, like bullying or even sexual assault. So what’s happened is that your wife’s not trusted anymore. I get it. I wouldn’t trust her either.\n\nYou say you get what she was trying to do, but you don’t really show any of the same empathy for your daughter. That’s really disturbing to me.\n\nMy guess is that this is part of what the boy was reacting to, and yes, he shouldn’t be disrespectful to your wife. But he’s in this chaotic environment and now his sister is falling apart and he’s seeing a new side of an adult he thought was solid. I get that too. It’s normal for a kid his age to be lashing out in this situation, and often kids push the hardest with those they feel the safest with. Your wife absolutely shouldn’t allow disrespect, but she also needs some empathy and she needs to leave parenting and discipline to you.\n\nYou may be able to fix some of this OVER TIME with patience and sincere apology to the daughter and actually listening to them. Family therapy, if they want it, may help if you and your wife are serious about doing it the right way, or individual therapy for the kids if you aren’t. Or either way. It sounds like they could use it. With a serious, secular, experienced therapist.\n\nBut yeah, your wife fucked up and honestly you don’t seem to be doing much better.",

    "selftext": "My daughter turns 3 in a couple days and has always been a really good sleeper. Since ~6 months she was sleeping in her own room for ~11 hours a night and rarely would we need to go in. Usually only for sickness. She's had some sleep regressions (most notably at ~18 months she'd wake up at 4:30-5 every day for a month or so) but it's all been manageable until now.\n\n\nA month or two ago we turned her crib into a toddler bed (same frame but removed bars on one side so she can get in and out). This generally hasn't been a problem, and initially she slept better in the toddler bed than the crib because when she'd wake up in the morning she'd go play with toys in her room rather than yell at us to get her, Then, her \"time to wake\" clock would turn green and she'd ask for us.\n\n\nThis all changed about two weeks ago. It started with her wanting the door open at night. Her room is at the top of the stairs, and our room is downstairs, AND we have really annoying cats. We tried telling her we can't keep the door open or else the cats will wake her up (which has happened in the past and she hates), but closing the door was instant tantrum to the point where she almost threw up. So, we relented and kept the door open at night, then closed it after a couple hours when she was asleep. We told her if she got out of bed we'd have to close the door, which she respected. This was fine for about a week.\n\n\nHOWEVER, now when she does her mini-wakeups at night she will SCREAM that she wants mommy and daddy until we go check on her. We ended up just leaving the door open which helped for a night or two (although she'd wake up an hour earlier than normal due to the cats), but now even with the door open she will scream for us 8-9 times a night. We are all exhausted. My work is suffering. My spouse's work is suffering. I think my child is close to getting kicked out of daycare due to how miserable she's been there the past week due to being so tired (throwing her snack, not listening to teachers, throwing massive tantrums if she has to do something she wants to do, etc).\n\n\nWhat can we do? We suspect this stems from anxiety thanks to my genes. We've tried:\n\n* Night light\n* Sleeping on a mattress outside her door\n* Staying in her room while she falls asleep\n* Letting her pick out a special new blanket and pillow\n* Moving white noise machine closer to the door and turning it up a little\n* Letting her keep her Yoto mini in her bed so she can listen to it\n\nNothing works. She is still up almost every hour from 10pm-7am. We are close to just saying fuck it and putting a mattress in her room and one of us sleeping with her at night. We REALLY don't want to do this because we desperately need solo/duo decompression time at night and we don't to be stuck sleeping in her room for months/years. But, I don't know what else to try at this point. Anyone go through something similar and have some pointers?\n\nIt's worth noting that she still naps, 1.5-2 hours ~1-3pm. I really don't want to drop her nap because she clearly needs it still (she's rubbing her eyes constantly since this all started, and occasionally says she's sleepy), and also daycare legally has to give every kid the opportunity to nap, and because (traditionally) my daughter has loved sleep, she'll always opt for the nap.",

Her sleep has looked sort of like this:\nWakes up at 5:30am, falls back asleep 45 minutes later and stays asleep until 8/8:30am, i attempt to put her down for a nap at 1pm and she stays awake in her crib for about an hour.\n Then as a result she has meltdowns at 4pm on the dot from being overtired, and is passed out a minute after being put in her crib at 6pm.\nBefore this regression started she was waking up at 7am, having her nap at 12:30pm and sleeping until 2/2:30pm and her bedtime was 7:15pm. Life was good!!! Minimal tantrums or none to be found.\nNow I just don't know what to do, i know most 2 year kids still need their nap and aren't ready to drop one but this is the longest we've gone like this. I miss her schedule and I miss her happy go lucky self!!\nAny advice? Did your 2 year old go through something similar? Tell me it won't last much longer 😅\n(I also want to point out it's very clear how much she's been learning from this regression the past few weeks, her vocabulary and speech has gone crazy!)\n\nTdlr; newly turned 2 toddler suddenly not napping and having more tantrums",

He only says a few words.\n\nThis morning dropping off my  3.5 year old at preschool, which by the way is his THIRD day of ever being in a school setting in his little life, the teacher grabbed my son before I had a chance to hug him and said “you’re fine! You’re a big boy!” \n\nThen she let a teacher aide bring my son into the classroom while she hugged another crying kid and comforted him. (?!)\n\nThis really bothered me because I don’t use such dismissive language at home. Calling a 3 year old imho a “big boy” is dismissive, negates their feelings and is expecting the child to behave in ways in which they are not developmentally ready. It’s ok to feel sad and it’s ok to miss your mom on the THIRD day of school. \n\nAm I overthinking things? Am I the one that’s being too sensitive? Should I let it go? I understand being a preschool teacher isn’t easy, but the way she talked to my son really rubbed me the wrong way. My son just walked to the classroom crying and it broke my heart. What should I do? I don’t want her talking that way to my son, and I want to advocate for him, but I also don’t want her to dislike me and treat my son differently if I bring it up to her. \n\n",

For example - Miss Eldest Child was having a hard time after school the other day, and I knew she wasn't going to happily converse in that moment (she is a bit \"prickly\" when cross - like me!) so I invited her to come and cook dinner - she spent maybe half an hour in the kitchen with me, getting instruction and praise for her work. Later that night as she was getting ready for bed we sat and chatted for maybe an hour. It's a really effective way of communicating with her.\n\nMy youngest struggles to use their words when they have big feelings, I'll correct behaviour (for example, it's not acceptable for them to hit their sibling) but to reconnect we cuddle and I usually manage to converse with them while we do that.\n\nBoth of my kids respond much better to being given additional information (ie - I can't let you do xyz because of xyz, rather than don't do that), we have many dinner time conversations that can get quite deep and plenty of quick car chats.\n\nNot sure if there's anything there that is useful but if I was to summarize I would say:\n\n1. Communicate frequently - the more you chat in general, the easier it will be to communicate when emotions get high.\n\n2. Figure out if your child needs something else to receive your message - for example, my youngest who needs a hug at the same time.\n\n3. Give them more - talk to them like they are smart (because they are), I try to talk to my kids like they are fully formed humans and they hate it when other adults speak down to them. \n\nGood luck, this parenting gig is hard!",

    "selftext": "I have a 1.5m and a 3f. They are both at a grabby “mine” age and we’ve been battling it a lot. But also trying to teach sharing. Most of the time it’s just about not snatching. Tonight my son wanders into the garage to play in the swing chair. My daughter comes over with us and wants in too. I tell her not right now, her brother is using it. He plays some more then wants down and wanders back into the yard. My daughter calls me back asking for help with the chair so I go over, ask if she wants it outside, then bring it out. She climbs in then offers her brother a spot when wants up too. They swing shortly then both want it to themselves. I get my son down and explain his sister was in it first this time. He moves on to playing with bubbles. I get the good bubble wand and now of course my daughter wants it. I tell her no and they have to share and take turns. After him having several attempts with it, and continually dropping it in the bottle I get it out and ask if his sister can have a turn now. This creates uproar with him and she has snatched the wand. I’m trying to diffuse the situation and dad chimes in about how our daughter is acting and how my son is going to hate me if I do that kind of thing all the time.\n\nI wasn’t going to make either kid give up the chair to take turns. But bubbles that he hasn’t quite grasped, after 10 tries I feel it’s fair to ask them to take turns. Am I being unreasonable or unfair towards my son?",

Sometimes I get lucky & only have to deal with 10-20 minutes of pure yelling & screaming. Other nights it can take over an hour to put him to sleep & by the time he is sleep I’m sleep as well then I wake up in the middle of the night and go lay in my bed. It’s like bed time just can’t be relaxing for him & I’m at my wits end. I can’t help but to lose my patience it’s frustrating because I want bed time to be a relaxing moment I give him a bath every single night , we will read a few books , sometimes I let him play before bed, & once I turn the light off all hell breaks loose. If I try to comfort him he gets even more mad throwing himself around acting like someone is trying to murder him. It gets to the point to where I have no choice but to hold him in place until he calms down because he refuses to even just lay still. If I don’t hold his legs he will play with his feet all night or kick at the walls if he’s angry. Which is irritating because I want him to lay on his own not me forcing him to lay or him having to have a whole entire breakdown to tire himself out. Idk I guess I’m just venting . When does this get better ? I can’t keep up with the outburst & getting kicked at because he’s flopping all around going nuts . I’m also pregnant so idk if my patience is extra thin because of that but the stomach kicking is just beyond me. I even put sleepy time bubbles in the bath sometimes the soak salts , I just went and got some lotion & spray I feel like all of this shit is a scam. I don’t mind having to sit with him until he sleeps it’s just the build up that it takes for him to actually calm down and lay is annoying asf & then once he is calm laying down he’s usually just playing around with his toes or fingers. Idk I’m just annoyed. I hope this ends soon or I can at least get it under control before the baby gets here & I can’t even close his room door because the knob is broken so that also isn’t an option & even if it was I’m pretty sure my son has night vision because he literally will get up in the pitch black & find stuff to play with .…",

She has said she still likes both of them equally but a couple days ago P wanted her to not play with M at recess and Chloe's decided to play with M anyway. Today she said she wanted to sit with P at lunch but her table was full so she sat with M. My daughter did say that she hasn't played with P much this year because of P and M no longer getting along and M asks her to play first. I did tell her that maybe P is feeling left out and she should ask her to play with her tomorrow. Also I have pretty bad ADHD so no one has gotten an invitation yet for my daughters birthday, I just ordered them, they will be sent to school Friday with my daughter but she is fully planning to invite P. I hope that this post isn't actually pertaining to us but if it is I just wanted to say that Chloe loves P still (and still calls her her bff). If it's not, I'm sure that Chloe also still loves your daughter. Unfortunately 9 is a very temperamental age I think. Prepuberty is kicking in. The friendships that they have had since the beginning change and then change back again. OP I highly recommend that you reach out to the moms and just touch base, if my daughter was making her friend feel excluded I would want to know so I could chat with her about it. The friendship may actually be over or it could just be temporary but I would want to teach about empathy in a situation like this.

She is going to grade 1 on Tuesday (Less than 1 week from today).\n\nI sent her to summer camp with the same organization as she did her before/after care. It's almost daycare style in a building with a playground. She was doing OK in the summer camp, although never liked it and always dreaded going, but this last week she's been crying every morning, and I talked to her teachers and she won't play or speak with anyone. She's been faking issues to come home (and the staff have been calling me to pickup everytime). When I try to talk to her about it, she's very reluctant but basically says \"When I walk in, everyone looks at me and I don't like it\". She's always been shy/introverted, but has always made friends/ played with other kids, enjoyed her school.\n\nI'm now worried what things are going to look like next week with going back to real school. From your experience, could it just be the summer camp/type of summer camp, or should I be more concerned about a larger issue? I've tried to talk to her about bullying, if she feels safe, etc but I'm not getting anywhere.\n\nAny and all advice is welcome! I'm at a loss as to what to do.\n\n  \nEDIT  - I just wanted to add she's a good kid. She's likeable, respectful, kind to others, listens to the rules - she's just shy.

I was looking to enroll my son into swimming and maybe soccer when summer comes around and invite them but I can already assume they’d turn it down.. before it’s assumed no it’s not because Kai is enrolled, it’s because my son has shown high interest in these activities and we finally financially can afford it. \n\nAnything for Kai they will literally be there with in a drop of a hat. When it’s for my son my partner says maybe not because they don’t really go to these things. When in reality they do.. for Kai..\n\nNow I don’t know if I would be entitled to speak with my partner about this because I know he doesn’t see what I see but on one hand my son is step grand son and Kai is full blooded but on the other hand they have known my son since he was born. It makes me want to stop taking my son over there as he does get heavily left out and not treated the same.",

He is attached to my husband, but not in the same way. \n\nAnyway, we both really want to be there tomorrow to drop him off and see him off. However, I wonder if walking away from not only one, but both of us would be too hard for him. Should only one of us do it? I just can't imagine not seeing him off on his first day. Also, we can have the teachers get him from the lobby or we can walk him to the classroom. Which is better?\n\nI know it may be a tough transition for the first couple of weeks.

    "selftext": "My kiddos respond best to fun tools and games that are flexible enough to be used in real life situations, so I’ve been working on finding ways to “gamify” life tips. It started with my son; he often has trouble with social cues, and his brain works so fast that he often blurts out sentences or other things in inappropriate environments, or with inappropriate people. So I came up with the Minefield game, to teach him about how certain topics or behaviors might be acceptable in one environment but not the other, and once he learned the concept, I created a code so that in public, I can alert him when he’s about to step on a “mine.” For example, when we go to my parents’ house, talking about his astronomy self-education or Harry Potter are no go’s, so I make eye contact and yank on my earlobe. Burping or farting at the store, or potty humor? Earlobe yank. \n\nThen when we started having some serious emotional outbursts due to sassing, bear-poking or other such sibling torture, we instituted feelings farts. I told them that when they’re feeling some kinda way, it’s okay to feel that way, but it’s not okay to lash out at everyone else. It’s like they’re crop-dusting their feelings and we all have to coexist with their emotional flatulence, and it stinks. They found this hilarious, of course, and so now the calm down methods are “emotional Beano”, and if someone makes the effort to be kind even if someone else is feeling-farting, it’s a feeling flower. Provocation can be called out by saying, “stop giving your sibling emotional burritos!” It’s safe in public because we can just sniff and react; either it stinks or ooooh that smells good. \n\nJust now, I created Zonk. Military vets MIGHT know this one. I plan to teach them to hide and not come out til it’s clear. If I catch them before they get to their safe place I’m gonna tickle them. If they beat me there I’m giving them a chocolate. Hopefully it’s only ever a game, but if our safety should ever be threatened, I can tell the kids to zonk and they will run for cover and not come out til I say it’s all clear. \n\nDoes anyone have any other fun gamified safety tips to teach kids helpful skills without making them paranoid?

    "title": "Wife and I were one and done, but wife now wants another. At a loss as to what to do.",
    "selftext": "I'm writing this largely to just get it off my chest, and hear the thoughts of others as I'm at a real loss as to what to do. Essentially, my wife and I when we had our son who has just turned 3 were both one and done. While I remain this, my wife has recently told me that she'd like to have another child.\n\n**Background**\n\nMy wife and I both 35 living in Sydney Australia. We got together in our early 20's, got married in 2019 and had our son in 2022. We make reasonable money and are relatively comfortable. We own our home (with a mortgage) and lead a relatively comfortable (if not modest) life - for example we have a budget that we try to stick to, we can afford grocceries etc, we have about 30K in savings, we can go out for dinner every now and again, but our savings typically fluctuates either up or down by $1000 a month depending on how much we save vs. any larger expenses. We do try to keep things sensible though - we don't do extravagant holidays or drive a particuarly fancy car for example.\n\n**My wife's view**\n\nAbout a month ago she mentioned that she was no longer one and done, and wanted to have another child. She'd mentioned a few times in the past that she'd had moments where she felt like she wanted to do it again, but had attributed this to mourning the loss of something that our son no longer did or had grown out of. However, over the last six months that feeling hadn't gone away and that she'd like to have one more.\n\nWith our son now 3, and with us being 35, she says that if we're going to do it, we should do it in the next year or so, or not at all, as she doesn't want a huge age gap between them and her biological clock is ticking.\n\n**My response**\n\nFollowing her telling me this we didn't speak about it for a couple of weeks (she told me on a day when we were both WFH right before I was heading into a meeting). I thought about it a lot and had planned to speak about it on a Sunday evening after our son had gone down. I wanted us to have some uninterrupted time where we both weren't exhausted from work. Unfortunately we got COVID, so neither of us were in the headspace for that conversation. Before I could broach the topic, my wife did while we were lying in bed a few nights ago.\n\nI essentially outlined that I was still one and done based on the following:\n\n* Financially we're able to live quite comfortably and provide a good life for our son. He's able to do activities, we can buy him things, experiences etc. Looking ahead, he's likely just going to get more expensive and I don't want to have him denied experiences or opportunites because we can't afford it.\n* What I can provide as a dad - I want to be the best dad I can for my son, and I think I'm pretty good at it. However I think one of the reasons I am a good dad, is that by only having one I have the chance to 'fill my own cup' every now and again. If we bring another child into that, time for us becomes even more limited, and suddenly that cup I'm trying to pour from is empty, so the quality of my parenting would dip.\n* Contentment with our current family - I love our family more than anything. I love the life we have. I love that we can provide a good life for our son, and I don't feel the urge\n* Logistically having just the one child is much simpler. Between the two of us we can manage work, day care drop offs, activities etc.\n* Space - our current home is four bedrooms (our room, our son's room, the study which I use as a home office, and the spare room which my wife uses as a home office). Having another child would mean losing either the spare room or the study leaving us with far less space (unfortunately with Sydney property prices and what we do for work, we can't afford to move anywhere larger).\n* Fear of disabilites - This one I understand is a stretch, but I'm trying to be as honest as I can (and this was a concern with my first son), there are disabilites that can't be tested for.\n\nAt the end I suggested we perhaps speak with a couples counsellor to help us talk through this.\n\n**Her response**\n\nShe was understandbly not happy with my views, and essentially took the line of \"we can make it work.\" for all of the concerns I raised. While I agree, if we did end up having a child we could make it work, but at what cost? One point in particular that she spoke to was the financial side, citing that we still have a lot of our son's stuff that we could reuse, and that the child would only be on formula for the first six months (whereas I'm considering this from a two-decade long view and all the expenses that come with raising a child).\n\nTo her credit, she handled it really well all things considered. While we were speaking I asked how strong her urge to have another child was and she let me know it was a real desire, but not a burning desire that without it would leave her feeling incomplete as a person.\n\nShe didn't think a counsellor was necessary.\n\n**Current situation**\n\nI suggested we speak about it again the next weekend, to give us some time to think and allow us to have the convo when we both weren't exhausted from work.\n\nSince then I've basically been thinking about it non-stop. I've acknowledged to myself that another child could be nice, but it's always immediately followed by all of the reasons I don't think it's the right move.\n\nMy above views haven't changed but feelings are:\n\n* Guilt - I feel like I'm denying her something she really wants. We could make it work, but as I don't have the desire to expand our family beyond the 3 of us, I don't want to be in a position where we HAVE to make it work. Conversely, I'm also concerned that if we don't do it, what that will do to her? Is she going to think about it every time we hang out with or see a family of four?\n* Worry of resentment - I'm worried that by denying her this, she'll resent me. I wouldn't blame her in the slightest. If the situation was reversed, I'd resent her.\n\nI've had moments where I've considered just doing it. I know that when the concept of a second child actually became the reality of a second child, the parental insticts would kick in and I'd love it with everything I have, but I've always held the view that if you're not 100% sure on having a child, you shouldn't do it.\n\nIn a nutshell, I just feel like a piece of shit because I don't wan't, not that I can't, but that I don't want to have another child, and that as a result of my views, she's not able to have something she really wants.",

She’s thinking about the rest of her life, 20-40+ years in the future and imagining what her Christmas table looks like when she is an old lady.

        "body": "Your son's situation is called \"Conflicting Nationalities\", a term created by Chinese government to open a way for people to keep dual citizenship, because your son is considered by Chinese law to be a Chinese citizen, who just happens to also have the citizenship of another country when he was born. So unless your son specifically renounces his Chinese citizenship, he will always be considered by Chinese government a Chinese citizen and hence enjoy all the benefits of Chinese citizenship - Hukou, Chinese National ID card, etc.\n\nSince he is considered by Chinese government a Chinese citizen, he won't get visa from Chinese consulates as visas are for non-Chinese citizens visiting China.\n\nSo as a Chinese citizen, your son can either apply for a Chinese passport or a Chinese Travel Document. Now, if you intend to keep your Moroccan citizenship, I'd suggest you apply for Chinese Travel Document. It can be used together with your son's Moroccan passport to enter and leave China. It just needs to be renewed every two years.\n\nYou can also go for Chinese passport, the problem is that it is OK for your son to enter China with Chinese passport but it would be impossible for him to leave China without a foreign visa on his Chinese passport. The Chinese Border Control/Immmigration officers will ask you how can you enter a foreign country if you don't have visa on your passport. Showing the Border Control officer your son's Moroccan passport will not work because your son is traveling on Chinese passport and hence he needs visa on his Chinese passport to leave China.\n\nOf course, one solution is that you can choose detour through a country that doesn't require visa to visit, say Thailand. Your son can go to Thailand without a visa on his Chinese passport and then go from Thailand to whatever country you want to go to with your Moroccan passport but it is not the most convenient way to go about these things.\n\nThe downside of Travel Document is that it has to be renewed every two years while Chinese passport needs to be renewed every 5 years.\n\nSo it's up to you to decide that you want a Travel Document or a Passport. But your son simply can't get a visa unless he specifically renounces his Chinese citizenship, which I don't recommend and nor am I sure that it can be done when your son has not yet reached adulthood (age of 18).",

There's no mention of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, funded by the CIA to commit terrorist attacks across Xinjiang and which is the primary reason the Chinese government had to crack down.  Many members of the ETIM were \"ratlined\" to Syria after their defeat by Chinese government forces.  There was a Muslim Cleric visit to Xinjiang and they found no evidence of discrimination.\n\nPepe Escobar had an article that is at least 10 years old (maybe 15) describing the difficulty in \"industrializing\" Xinjiang.  When China began to invest in the area, Uyghurs were not qualified for the management positions so they mostly went to Han.  This discrepancy has almost been remedied as education in Xinjiang was very successful.\n\nThe author, [GREG SCADUTO](https://substack.com/@gregcscaduto), is a China fear monger.

    "selftext": "Well, i live in Germany and had a Job interview and booked an AirBnBfor 2 days , i discovered that my host lives in the appartment, she's chinese.   \n  \nDay 1 : She offered to cook for me which i accepted at the condition we would go for the groceries first which we did. We started talking the whole night about human relationships (in general) from 6pm to 1a.m. I played some guitar (she's renting the house for a year and the owners have a guitar)  \nShe was looking sad so i asked what was going on ? she revealed how she struggled in life when she was in China and so on and mentionned that she bought a Kayak that she never used and wanted to try, well i do own one and i know how it works, so i offered her to do some kayaking after my job interview the next day. She asked me she would cook for me for lunch or was i getting late. Well i declined since i finish at 4pm.  \n  \nDay 2 : i missed lunch at work (interview is a 1 day work at hospital). Went back home and then we ate something quick then i asked her if she still wanted to do Kayak, She said yes so we went to do it for an hour.  After we went back home she told me, go have some rest i'll cook for you.  \nShe did i helped ofc, we ate and then we talked mainly about romantic relationships. She kept telling me you are so rare cause you're like the Standard of healthy relationships and so on as she heard me talk to my mom and friends after the job interview when i went back home.   \n\n\n2 Days later:  i sent her a reel showing a place in Europe she told me she wanted to visit someday. She said she wanted to travel next week, i didn't know if she was suggesting or not so i told her if you want some accompany let me know as i would like to travel too before starting to work.  \nSo we ended up planning a 3 days trip to Austria, which went very well.   \nShe asked me about my religion and if my future wife should follow it and if my son too etc..  \nAter that the 2nd day of the trip she told me she made the decision to go work in japan next year as she was staying here in germany just for a year.  \n\n\nAfter that she told me it was ehr best trip, and that i was rare because we 'connected' that deep and i made her 'felt seen'.\n\nDuring all those times no kiss no touching nothing.  \nSince everything seemed platonic even with some interest i moved back.  \n\n\n2weeks laters she told me : well i think what you said about my anxiety was right, knowing what i have helped me, i should treat you a diner. I replied i would love to. She said she meant it and we ended up planning it the last friday.   \nFriday Diner : As i arrived she told me ok let's go to the museum of the city, she made me a tour of it and then we went back home, she cooked for me we talked a lot. Again the romantic relationship subject popped up. I noticed how she was doing BF/GF thigns with me and told her you have a need and you need to pursue it in general not talking about me. It's normal, as she had childhood trauma with her parents not showing her much love, she said, i don't need it i don't want to wake up every morning next to someone. I emphasized that she was going too deep into the relationship so early even when it's just theoretically. Well i didn't push anymore, i just wanted to go back home.  \nI had to take my train but since we been feeding the ducks and watching sunset i missed it.  \nWe went back home waiting for the next, so i moved a bit away from her and went to the next room (no door it's a big open area) and played some guitar, she came around me while playing and soon as i put my phone on charge she took it and tried to play some. I asked if she wanted to learn she said yeah, well you all know how it goes it becomes touchy , we were like holding hands, she didn't avoid or anything she accepted it, and even gave me a look in the middle of it, i honestly melted, but couldnt go further since she turned awa right after. Well she tayed next to me side by side for a long 5min after that while diving into her phone. She's more smiling and more talkative ever since even on Instagram.\n\nYesterday i asked how was life going (3 days after the diner), and we talked she told me she decided to stay longer in Germany and maybe find a job here.\n\nMy question is, is she just wanting someone to support her emotionnaly as a friend or is she pursuing step by step something more romantic ?\n\nNote that her past made her have an avoidant kinda perosnnality when it comes to commitment.",

The avoidant personality you mentioned is common among Chinese, and some Chinese girls are afraid to be seen as too forward in pursuing a relationship.\n\nHowever, I would caution you as well that you barely know this girl, you know her from an online transaction basically, so be on your guard.  Could be someone who's just looking for anyone to get married to so they can stay in your country, as much as it could be someone who's genuinely interested in you.  See whether she probes you about your finances.  On the flip side, if she can afford to spend a year in Germany doing nothing, she might also be from a wealthy Chinese family, and doing Airbnb is just a way for her to meet new people.",

Of course, it's good to be cautious since she could be using you to stay in the country, but it could be worth exploring to see if it's genuine, particularly if you have an interest in her. \n\nIf you are interested in her, what the heck are you waiting for? I'm not sure what more she could have done to show you, other than grab your face and kiss you.",
